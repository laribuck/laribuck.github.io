story but with more context (dont have to read but only if you want to understand more): Atticus woke up covered in blood, wondering what happened to him before he blacked out. He then stumbled across a dead body, a worker he killed. Suddenly, memories came flooding back.<br />He goes on about how he tried to change it all, tried to convince the scientists that what they're doing is wrong. After realizing in the place he grew up in that he was just born to be a test subject. His friends and family gone one day to go to the &quot;special&quot; place and coming back a demented beings. Only the same fate will happen to him. He figured soon that what they were trying to do: create a being that can survive death. After seeing his loved ones being shot and killed when they were labeled as &quot;failures&quot;. While being in the test tube and being pumped unknown chemicals in oddly questable places Atticus attempted to befriend the scientists for answers, a few spilling some, most staying quiet. Although he tried and tried all he got was flashbacks of people dying around him. He eventually lost it and blacked out. Then woke up from what could be considered death.<br />He was the success.<br />The success that destroyed the people who made him.<br /><br />ok the quality died since it fucking took hours to actually get the video together i literally had to export it as a png sequence (surprised my computer survived 948 frames of this shit) then put it all into movie maker as &quot;scenes&quot; (just every 200 frames or so) because doing it all at once isn't acceptable according to my computer apparently because it &quot;takes up too much space&quot; (dude i literally have over 159 GB free what the hell do you mean) so yeah it's out of sync in some places and the quality suffered but it was all worth it <br />also do you like my intro??? the lil thunder boom??? i do bc i wanna slap it everywhere now<br />also i might make amv's and pmv's more often because god i missed doing actual animation<br /><br />this was all based on this: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTn1j8Pv0Zw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTn1j8Pv0Zw</a><br />it was never intended to a meme, so i gave respect and didnt do is as a meme, i did it as an amv instead lol<br /><br />song <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaELvNRmH5c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaELvNRmH5c</a><br />outro <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/thexsha/xxyyxx...">https://soundcloud.com/thexsha/xxyyxx...</a><br />deviantart <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://deviantart.com/caeruleumm">https://deviantart.com/caeruleumm</a><br />twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/pastarru">https://twitter.com/pastarru</a><br /><br />god this is a fucking long ass description
