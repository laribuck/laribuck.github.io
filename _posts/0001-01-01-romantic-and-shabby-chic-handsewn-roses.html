I made this  picture video of some of the roses I have made the recent year. They are all sold but I will make some  again now and put up in my little blogshop. if you are a international customer I will put it up on my zibbet shop for you on your request for easier payment with paypal. These are not embelishment roses, they are for home decor. Anyways I hope you enjoyed.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.zibbet.com/Lineca">http://www.zibbet.com/Lineca</a><br /><br />Lele
