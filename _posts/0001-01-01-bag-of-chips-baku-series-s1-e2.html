NO VEGETABLES. Can I get a bag of chips with that? Make sure its boneless. Baku has a little bit of a situation after assuming someone's gender. Genderflux? Genderfuck? Binary gender system? Understandable, have a great day.<br />This video is a joke, it does not reflect my political views on gender equality, gender identity, LGBTQ+, ftm, mtf, etc. No genderflux or genderfuck trigger intended.<br />Shirts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/sethical-shirts">https://teespring.com/stores/sethical-shirts</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Sethical_">https://twitter.com/Sethical_</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Sethical">https://www.patreon.com/Sethical</a><br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/who.tf.took.sethical">https://www.instagram.com/who.tf.took.sethical</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/gZTWRqv">https://discord.gg/gZTWRqv</a>
