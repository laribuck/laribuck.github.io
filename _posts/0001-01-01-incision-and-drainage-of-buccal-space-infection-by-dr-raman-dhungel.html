Buccal space infection may occur due to odontogenic infection from premolars and molars of either mandibular or maxillary dentition. When the abscess is so severe that no intraoral access can be made for drainage, the abscess has to be drained extraorally and the offending tooth should be removed once sufficient mouth opening can be achieved. <br /><br />This case was done by Dr. Raman Dhungel at Khotang District Hospital, Diktel Nepal.
