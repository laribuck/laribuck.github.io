Writing code, selling to customers, or creating a long term vision for a start up all require passion, programming, and pragmatism, but how much of each?  How can you be passionate and pragmatic at the same time? &quot;Passion, Programming, and Pragmatism&quot; is a tech entrepreneurs’ personal story about remedying the tension between being passionate and being pragmatic.<br /><br />Marcella is a Fall 2014 graduate of Skidmore College with a BA in Government and minor in Computer Science.  As a quintessential liberal arts student, she enjoys reading philosophy equally as much as writing code.  Marcella’s founded her most recently company, Anthill, at 19 years old in order to connect millennials with freelance jobs right down the road.  Even as a recent grad, she’s had eight different jobs doing everything from lobbying for universal health care, to software engineering, to most recently working at a hedge fund that manages a multi-billion dollar portfolio.  Nothing, however, had added fuel to her fire like incubating a start up.  Marcella is dedicated to increasing millennial employment, and helping millennials achieve a level of self-actualization only reached by having experienced various people, industries, and work styles.  <br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
