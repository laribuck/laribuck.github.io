Travel through three counties of unsettled wilderness The area was only ever settled by hostile Indians and three settlements of coal miners that moved out in 1884, when the coal was gone. So stay with me Lord willing we will go back over 20 miles of abandon railroad beds. The only connection of the outside world on that stretch of railroad bed is the Appalachian trail.
