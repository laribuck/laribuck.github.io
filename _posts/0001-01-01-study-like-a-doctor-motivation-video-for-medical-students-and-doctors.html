Once you’ve decided to go that route of being a physician. Once it says D.O or M.D after your name. That is you. Okay, so if you get a phone call and it’s from a patient even if you’re not on call or even if you’re not working that week. You have to take that seriously. That is what you are. You are a physician. You’ve earned it. And people are looking for you to use it. But the one thing that I will tell anyone, everyday of my life is I will work harder than you. Period. Like that’s just, it’s not about being like “oh I wanna be better than that you know pulmonologist over there”. Nonono, you lose competition through authenticity. Nobody is better at being you. And so, you get to be yourself. Once you own it you know that it’s just a part of you and its a part of you. It’s just another piece of you. Okay and that’s what’s awesome about it. <br /><br />You really see these people coming from the emergency room. You work them up. You talk to them. You get their diagnosis. And you’re the ones who take them now to the operating room to do the procedure and you watch them go through the healing process and you discharge them home. And for me seeing that entire continuum of patient care from very beginning when they walk into the hospital to watching them walk out of the hospital doors has been very very rewarding and I think it’s those moments that make me remember why I wanted to do surgery in the first place. <br /><br />I know it’s tough when you’re in school and you’re studying. You’re just waiting for it to be over and you’re waiting to pass. Trust me though, working, you’re going to be working the rest of your life. I would actually see things from a different lens. I would say, see things in a way where you actually enjoy the moment that you’re in. And let that absorb. Let all that sink in. When are you ever going to be in optometry school again or medical school. I think I’d really just enjoy the process because it’s all about the journey or getting there. It makes you who you are today. And if you just got your degree the first day you went to school and you finished in  one day. There is no history to that. There is no experience. There is no education. I would just enjoy the journey. <br /><br />As a doctor you have the potential to impact hundreds maybe thousands of lives just treating patient on an individual basis right. <br /><br />I can’t think of any other job where I meet somebody and in 15 to 20 minutes I’m asking them the most personal questions that I could ever ask. Often questions that their spouses don’t even know. And so don’t take that relationship for granted. It is very sacred. And make sure you always tried to put your patients first. <br /><br />=========================<br /><br />Follow me: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/medicalmind...">https://www.instagram.com/medicalmind...</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/medicalmindset/">https://www.facebook.com/medicalmindset/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/medical_mindset">https://twitter.com/medical_mindset</a>
