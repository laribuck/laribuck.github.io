Creative Human Person / Director / TED 2012 speaker / GEEK / 3D VFX artist / Educator. Founder of 1 Second Everyday. Accidental entrepreneur.<br />www.cesarkuriyama.com<br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
