In this video, myself and the brilliant Max Fosh went to Box Hill in Surrey to go for a stroll and enjoy the view.<br /><br />We discuss Max's first ever stand-up gig, how he gets the public to talk to him for Street Smart, his plans for the Edinburgh Fringe, our favourite fonts and how we'll inevitably both get cancelled.<br /><br />If you haven't seen Max's channel before, go and check it out: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb31gOY6OD8ES0zP8M0GhAw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb31gOY6OD8ES0zP8M0GhAw</a><br /><br />I'm going to be releasing a new episode in this series of walks every Saturday for the foreseeable future, so if you want to see the others, subscribe and ring that bell.<br /><br />Bin Day T-shirts on sale now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://robbieknoxmerch.com">http://robbieknoxmerch.com</a><br /><br />POST:<br />Robbie YouTube<br />PO Box 480<br />DARTFORD<br />DA1 9QN<br /><br />SOCIALS:<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/RobbieKnox">https://twitter.com/RobbieKnox</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/megarobbie">https://www.instagram.com/megarobbie</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@megarobbieknox">https://www.tiktok.com/@megarobbieknox</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/GDYXRPC">https://discord.gg/GDYXRPC</a><br /><br />Some of the links in this description may be affiliate links.
