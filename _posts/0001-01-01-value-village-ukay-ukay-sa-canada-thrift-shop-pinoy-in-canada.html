Savers is a thrift superstore with a community conscience. For more than 60 years, we've welcomed shoppers and neighbors into our stores and our hearts.<br /><br />Walk into any Savers store and you'll see shelves bursting with quality merchandise all inside a beautiful environment that's easy to shop and easy on the wallet. More than 10,000 fresh items are stocked each day, and that's in addition to the fabulous finds already in store. But you'll also discover something else: our commitment to your neighborhood and the world at large.<br /><br />We keep millions of items out of landfills by sending unsellable merchandise to recyclers to be repurposed and to developing countries to help individuals create their own marketplaces.<br /><br />With stores throughout the United States, Canada and Australia, chances are there's a Savers, Value Village or Unique thrift store near you. Head on over to shop, recycle your used clothing and household goods for reuse, or just to say hi. We've got something special in store.
