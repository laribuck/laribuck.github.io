Y2Jake impressed me heaps with his gameplay here. There are a lot of things to like, and not many obvious major mistakes. Coming up against aggressive players who dive in on items (and your position in general) can be a huge obstacle for newer players. Jake does a good job of punishing some situations here, but there are times when he needs to commit to stronger positions, and make sure he isn't giving his opponent easy entrances.<br /><br />Check out Episode 6 of the Smileyblue Podcast - I am one of the guests: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/wa38VFQOVAo">https://youtu.be/wa38VFQOVAo</a><br /><br />If anyone has games they want me to discuss in this format please get in contact either on Discord or by email: gaming@tommarks.xyz<br /><br />If you are an Aus/NZ dueller come join our new duel discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/kpQvnNQKXR">https://discord.gg/kpQvnNQKXR</a><br /><br />Cool people:<br />Y2Jake - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWT-4XapnpHjJiPA3rK3mLQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWT-4XapnpHjJiPA3rK3mLQ</a><br />Chugg - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ttdyjmIWMQyS2NoedlbWQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ttdyjmIWMQyS2NoedlbWQ</a><br />Smilecythe - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GroinMischief/videos">https://www.youtube.com/c/GroinMischief/videos</a><br />Mick05/4SeasonsGaming - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/4SGtube">https://www.youtube.com/user/4SGtube</a><br /><br />My socials ---<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/phy1um">https://twitter.com/phy1um</a><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/phylum919">https://twitch.tv/phylum919</a>
