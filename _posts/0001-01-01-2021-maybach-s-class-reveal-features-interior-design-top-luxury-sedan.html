The 2021 Mercedes-Maybach S-Class is particularly suitable for chauffeured driving. The 18 cm longer wheelbase compared to the long variant of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class entirely benefits theÂ rear. The focus on the rear area. This is underlined by even more refined appointments. The massage function of the calfrests on the Executive seats is a new feature. The First-Class Rear has been extensively upgraded. The neck/shoulder heating in the rear is another comfort feature.<br /><br />On request, the exclusive appearance of the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class can be enhanced by aÂ two-tone paint finishÂ with dividing line. This is applied by hand according to the highest quality criteria. Distinguishing features at the front include the distinctive bonnet with a chromed fin and the Mercedes-Maybach radiator grille with fine, vertical chrome pinstripes. The Mercedes-Maybach S-Class also differs from its brother models when viewed from the side: the rear doors are wider, and the C-pillars feature a fixed quarterlight. A Maybach brand logo on the C-pillar underlines the exclusivity.<br /><br />On request, the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class can be equipped with electrically operatedÂ comfort rear doors. With this feature, the wide rear doors can be conveniently opened and closed with little force even on a gradient. Integration into the infotainment and control system MBUX and Blind Spot Assist ensures a high level of operating convenience and additional safety. The rear doors can also be operated from the driver's seat â€“ an important function when chauffeur-driven.<br /><br />DIGITAL LIGHTÂ technology celebrated its world debut in small-series production of the preceding model, but is now in full series production with the new S-Class generation. This revolutionary headlamp technology (optional equipment) allows completely new functions, e.g. the projection of marking aids or warning symbols onto the road ahead. In each headlamp, DIGITAL LIGHT has a light module with three extremely powerful LEDs with light that is refracted and directed by 1.3 million micro-mirrors. The resolution is therefore more than 2.6 million pixels per vehicle.<br /><br />The interior of the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class is based on the completely newÂ interior designÂ of the new Mercedesâ€‘Benz S-Class. The large areas of trim on the front seats are a new feature in the Mercedes-Maybach. Highâ€‘quality wood surrounds encase the rear of the front seat backrests, giving the impression of generous lounge seats. If the First-Class Rear is specified, a similarly striking area of trim is positioned between the two rear passengers.<br /><br />WithÂ Active road noise compensation, the interior of the already very quiet Mercedes-Maybach S-Class becomes even quieter. In a similar way to headphones with noise suppression, the system reduces unwanted low-frequency noises using counter-phased sound waves. The bass speakers of the BurmesterÂ high-end 4D surround sound system are used for sound reproduction.<br />CoupÃ© and Cabriolet customers of Mercedes-Benz have long come to appreciate the automaticÂ seat belt extender. Rear passengers in the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class are now the first to benefit from this convenience in the rear of a saloon. The belt extender is an indirect invitation to fasten the belt, and also makes the process more convenient. It is no longer necessary to move from an adopted, comfortable seating position to fasten the belt. The belt extender is integrated into the adjustable backrest of the Executive seat, and therefore always in the right position for the passenger.<br /><br />Adaptive rear lightingÂ is celebrating its premiere in the Mercedes-Maybach. This follows the wishes of the occupants in several respects: as well as the brightness, the size and position of the light spot can be adjusted. There is also a wide adjustment range between precise working light and relaxing lounge light.<br /><br />It is expected that initially in Germany and from the second half of 2021, the Mercedes-Maybach will be able to drive in conditionally automated mode with the newÂ DRIVE PILOTÂ (optional equipment) in situations where traffic density is high or in tailbacks on suitable motorway sections. By taking pressure off the driver, this allows him/her to undertake secondary activities such as surfing the web or attending to emails in the In-Car Office. This allows a more effective use of time.<br /><br />Comment, like, dislike, share! ðŸ¤Ÿ<br /><br />Thanks for watching<br /><br />JOIN US to get your name on YOUCAR videos ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3cJEMzX">https://bit.ly/3cJEMzX</a><br /><br />Subscribe now to YOUCAR, it's free ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/5i54Vg">https://goo.gl/5i54Vg</a><br /><br />Exclusive car fans items ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youcarstore.com">http://youcarstore.com</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/youcar_official/">http://www.instagram.com/youcar_official/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/youcarpress/">http://www.facebook.com/youcarpress/</a><br /><br />#sclass #mercedesbenz #v223 #z223 #s580
