This is a mix of two smaller videos I did in the past week. We are fixing to get started on a pole barn within the next few weeks. It will be the start of our own little farm. This time of year not much going on with the bees so I will but posting videos about building this pole barn and installing the fences needed for now. Hope you stick around to see the progress.
