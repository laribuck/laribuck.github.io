The band and its lead singer Dennis Yost are principally known for the hits &quot;Spooky&quot;, &quot;Stormy&quot;, and &quot;Traces&quot;, released in 1967 to 1969, which have become cover standards.<br />The band changed its name to &quot;The Classics IV featuring Dennis Yost&quot; and enjoyed two more top-10 hits, &quot;Stormy&quot; (1968, No. 5) and &quot;Traces&quot; (1969, No. 2: Hot 100, No. 2 Easy Listening).
