Midsummer edition of Thus spoke Zarathustra<br /><br />ON THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS AUDIOBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/MeneoMsy7FGr/">https://www.bitchute.com/video/MeneoMsy7FGr/</a><br />Monero adress: <br />42KDrmLKFcAC8aXycUtnGZLrDGumRu7cc5Ve4oY9tMEGZjP4pcUsgULRfBLidrYsgPjWvJQbAXKsW5NqmRoyfCzX2YKWGSL <br /><br />Thus Spake Zarathustra) is a philosophical novel by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, composed in four parts between 1883 and 1885 and published between 1883 and 1891.<br /><br />The book chronicles the fictitious travels and speeches of Zarathustra. Zarathustra's namesake was the founder of Zoroastrianism, usually known in English as Zoroaster (Avestan: Zaraϑuštra). Nietzsche is clearly portraying a &quot;new&quot; or &quot;different&quot; Zarathustra, one who turns traditional morality on its head. He goes on to characterize &quot;what the name of Zarathustra means in my mouth, the mouth of the first immoralist:&quot;<br /><br />For what constitutes the tremendous historical uniqueness of that Persian is just the opposite of this. Zarathustra was the first to consider the fight of good and evil the very wheel in the machinery of things: the transposition of morality into the metaphysical realm, as a force, cause, and end in itself, is his work. [...] Zarathustra created this most calamitous error, morality; consequently, he must also be the first to recognize it. [...] His doctrine, and his alone, posits truthfulness as the highest virtue; this means the opposite of the cowardice of the &quot;idealist” who flees from reality [...]—Am I understood?—The self-overcoming of morality, out of truthfulness; the self-overcoming of the moralist, into his opposite—into me—that is what the name of Zarathustra means in my mouth.<br /><br />— Nietzsche, Ecce Homo, &quot;Why I Am a Destiny&quot;, §3, trans.
