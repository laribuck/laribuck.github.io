'In All The Right Places' was recorded by Lisa Stansfield and was intended, by John Barry, to be the main title song for the Robert Redford / Demi Moore movie, 'Indecent Proposal'. However, not liked by the director, the song was buried at the back of the films end titles. This is the gorgeous instrumental version that is heard briefly during the movie.<br />Solo Piano played by Michael Lang.<br />Composed, arranged and conducted by John Barry.
