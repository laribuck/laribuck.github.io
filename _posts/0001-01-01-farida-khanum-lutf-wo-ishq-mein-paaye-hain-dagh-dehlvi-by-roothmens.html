The Times of India has called her &quot;Malika-e-Ghazal&quot; (Queen of Ghazal).<br />In 2005, she was awarded the Hilal-e-Imtiaz, Pakistan's second highest civilian honour by President Pervez Musharraf.  Farida Khanum gave her first public concert in 1950 and then joined Radio Pakistan where she courted fame and fortune. She became a star when Pakistan's president Ayub Khan invited her to a public recital in the '60s.<br />The ghazal she is most associated with is Aaj Jaane Ki Zidd Naa Karo.<br />==========================<br />Nawab Mirza Khan (1831--1905)  نواب مرزا خان‎, , commonly known as Daagh Dehlvi  داغ دہلوی‎,  was an outstanding Mughal poet famous for his Urdu ghazals and belonged to the Delhi school of Urdu poetry. He wrote poems and ghazals under the takhallus  Daagh Dehlvi (the meanings of Daagh, an Urdu noun, include stain, grief and taint while Dehlvi means belonging to or from Delhi).<br />He lost his father at the age of six and was brought up by his stepfather, Mirza Muhammad Fakhroo, who was heir to Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal Emperor. On Fakhroo's death in 1865, Daagh left Delhi for Rampur where he went into government service and lived comfortably for 24 years. There followed a period of wandering and discomfort which ended when he was invited to Hyderabad in 1891. There he won his fame as an Urdu poet and lived a life of luxury. Hyderabad was a cradle to many poets of that period following the decline of Mughals in Delhi. He died in 1905 at the age of 74 in Hyderabad, India.<br />Daagh started reciting poetry at the age of ten and his forte was the ghazal. His work comprises four volumes consisting of 16,000 couplets.<br />Daagh mostly wrote ghazals which are sets of two-line couplets. Some of his couplets are highly quotable. For example, Tu hai harjai to apnaa bhi yehi taur sahi, tu nahin aur sahi, aur nahin, aur sahi<br />Having remained under patronage of highly established poet like Zauq, Daagh had numerous disciples including the poet of the East Allama Iqbal, Jigar Moradabadi, Seemab Akbarabadi and Ahasan Marharavi, though a widely quoted anecdote relates that when asked to designate his successor as the leading Urdu poet of his age, he replied Bekhudain , referring to Bekhud Badayuni and Bekhud Dehlvi.<br />His ghazals have been sung by noted ghazal singers including Noor Jahan, Ghulam Ali, Malika Pukhraj, Mehdi Hassan, and Abida Parveen.
