The Recordium Presents: Thee Sinseers!<br /><br />This is the 3rd and final song from our session with Thee Sinseers.<br /><br />This could possibly be a catchier tune than their first track &quot;Seems Like&quot; which people are really loving.<br /><br />Enjoy this track its a good one.<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Baby baby ,what you trying to do to me<br />Doing all the things that<br />You said youd never do to me<br />So tell me what's his name <br />Tell me what he likes to call you <br />Tell me how to fall<br />Out of love with you<br />Because I try (try try) to give you love<br />(Love love) but you keep lie lying and you keep running <br />So tell me ,tell me ,tell me, tell me who<br />And in the middle of the night when I'm all alone<br />I'll call you on the telephone<br />You keep telling me you care <br />When all i really wanna know <br />Is who he is<br /><br />So tell me tell me tell me who....
