An informal conversation between Jay Bolotin, artist<br />and Aprile Gallant, curator of prints, drawings, and photographs.<br /><br />This conversation was recorded at Smith College Museum of Art on June 25-29, 2012. During this time, a four day residency, the artist annotated his drawings by writing directly on the walls of the exhibition gallery--a process Bolotin describes as entirely &quot;reasonable.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Jay Bolotin: The Jackleg Testament&quot; is on view from June 29--September 9, 2012.
