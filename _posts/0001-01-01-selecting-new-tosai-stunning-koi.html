Today we started to move our Tosai (They are NOT ready to go yet)<br />With the many pre sales we have on the Koi we are getting them into variety order so when we do ship out the Koi, it's easy to select them. <br />There are still some Koi for sale so please get in touch if you want any of these Koi, please be quick. <br /><br />I will do a larger Koi video, but the ones I had to put on the video got sold today. <br /><br />You can email us info@qualitynishikigoi.com <br /><br />Call us on 01925 950401
