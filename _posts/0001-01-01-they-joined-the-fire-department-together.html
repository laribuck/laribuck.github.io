Ryan joined the local fire department, along side his dad who was a firefighter for almost 20 years before he retired in 2011! This is such a cool full circle moment to get to see! There are also new videos up on the homestead channel, check them out below...<br /><br />HOMESTEADING CHANNEL ∙ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5f0uIOkcdUff0UD1hAQU9Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5f0uIOkcdUff0UD1hAQU9Q</a><br />ARIANNA'S CHANNEL ∙ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/ariannapflederer">https://youtube.com/ariannapflederer</a><br />RYAN'S CHANNEL ∙ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/uncratedcrowd">https://youtube.com/uncratedcrowd</a><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />FAQ ⤵︎<br /><br />WHY DID WE START VLOGGING? Our unexpected viral wedding video pushed us to start posting videos more! Arianna started with cover songs and after doing the Husband Tag with Ryan, we were asked to vlog. So we decided to try it and we LOVE it 5 years later. We now post vlogs every Tuesday and Thursday!<br /><br />ARIANNA HAD A SERVICE DOG? Arianna had a service dog for 7 years. Levi has now since passed away. Arianna has PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) from her child and teen years. Greyson (Grey) is her service dog in training. He is being trained to do PTSD task work and will be learning additional mobility work to help Arianna with her Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. <br /><br />CHANNEL NAME CHANGE? Formerly we were ThePflederers then ThePfledPfam. We are forever now, It's Us. It's easier to remember, easier to say, and easier to spell. We feel it truly depicts our channel as well. It's us who are the change in the world. It's us who have control over our story. Authentic vlogs is what we strive for while also showing you guys that it is okay to dream and go against the norm and reach for something bigger. <br /><br />WHY DID WE MOVE STATES? We used to live in Illinois and moved to North Carolina in September of 2017. We have always talked about moving out of Illinois eventually! As a family we decided that North Carolina seemed like a good fit for us. Ryan found one of his dream job opportunities, and so we moved to NC as soon as the company made him an offer! <br /><br />ARE YOU A VEGAN FAMILY OR JUST PLANT-BASED? Arianna and the girls are vegan. As a family we eat plant-based. <br /><br />WHERE'D YOUR PO BOX GO? We so appreciate that you guys took the time to send our family letters and gifts. We had to make the decision to close our PO BOX due to just how amazingly generous you guys are. Being that we promote minimalism, we want to make sure that we as creators are displaying that way of living in every sense.
