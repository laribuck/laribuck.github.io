lyrics<br /><br /><br />i know the suns about to come up<br />i close my eyes anyway<br />my mouth is dry and the sheets are cold<br />and will be still come break of day<br />you called me up just to surprise me<br />to hear my voice, see what i had to say<br />i only whispered then hung up<br />i whispered, &quot;wait till break of day.&quot;<br />at the break of day im ending all of it<br />and so dont say youve had a ball<br />dawn is mine but i will share it<br />with whatever bird will wear it<br />on her body bare and pink<br />now what do you think of break of day?<br /><br />i locked my door, i should unlock it<br />what if you should come this way?<br />and in and have a drink and dancing<br />dancing till the break of day<br />and then to bed we danced towards<br />and tiredly kiss and roll in hay<br />but waking in the evening i see<br />you left after break of day<br />at the break of day im ending all of it<br />and so dont say youve had a ball<br />dawn is mine but i will share it<br />with whatever bird will wear it<br />on her body bare and pink<br />now what do you think of break of day?<br /><br />at the break of day im ending all of it<br />and so dont say youve had a ball<br />dawn is mine but i will share it<br />with whatever bird will wear it<br />on her body bare and pink<br />now what do you think of break of day?<br /><br />i hate myself when im alone<br />its just with you i feel ok<br />so tomorrow youll feel sorrow<br />when i am gone at break of day
