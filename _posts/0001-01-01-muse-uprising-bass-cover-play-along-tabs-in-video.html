Just neck pickup at full position. Try mantaining a constant playing motion and not sliding too much, so you get more of a synth vibe.<br /><br />- Gear Sound: Didn't use any pedals! Just digital processing. First i added a cabinet emulator and split signal in two. For the first one, just clean with some low and high end. Second one has an octaver first in chain (lower octave, and probably high octave can work too), then a fuzz pedal very high in the mix. After that added compression as usual (high compression), stereo chorus, and some eq for scooping some mids and some other little fixings. Really don't know what pedals Chris used, but i think the tone i used resembles enough, for not using any money on it<br /><br />- About The Song: SWING time is needed. You can search about swing or shuffle time. It's just playing 8th notes (in this case) with a feel of quarter followed by 8th in a triplet feel. After you get that and the octave, you just need some stamina and figure out the little feel almost at the end.<br /><br />Need more tips?
