‘Chains’ is the fifth Official music video released from Legitimate and Rex Seshunz forthcoming album ‘Only Built For Human Beings’. Producer Rex Seshunz sets the tone with a spine chilling piano and violin laced instrumental, held together with a neck snapping skip break and heart rattling bass line. The bleak and haunting soundscape evokes a feeling of hardship and unrest. Emcees Legitimate and Lay Low answer the call with gritty razor-sharpe lyricism and a dark street influenced bravado, with which they paint a picture of rebellious angst and discontent. The duo are able to harness the raw energy and hunger of the urban revolutionary! A mind-state forged beneath the near crushing weight of the chains of systemic struggle. ‘Chains’ portrays the mental and physical shackles placed upon the mind and body of today’s marginalized lower classes. The track also features a scratch outro from Lando. Video filmed and edited by Lay Low additional filming from Rex Seshunz , directed by Lay Low and Legitimate .
