Wearing makeup, we all know what that means and nodding off in Starbucks. <br /><br /><br />Keep in mind that Aarona knows that the police aren’t following her, that the weather, wi-fi, stores opening/closing times et cetera, these ramblings and accusations are for her benefit. She counts on new and naive followers hearing these claims and feeling sorry for her because she has to be mentally ill to think these things. She also counts on the more seasoned followers verbally attacking her or calling her names to further make her angels feel sorry for her which always leads to donations.  Those donations and the attention, be it positive or negative is what she thrives (and lives) on. Her family has asked that people stop donating so that she’ll come home and live normally. The only thing that will stop this cycle, other than an extended prison term or death would be a complete lack of attention (views and positive and/or negative comments). If you want to help her DON’T watch her YouTube, DON’T comment on her videos or posts and DON’T send her any money. <br />There are a number of places you can go to discuss her antics and watch video highlights. Facebook, Instagram and YouTube are goldmines for content related to Aarona. Google is your best tool to assist in the search.
