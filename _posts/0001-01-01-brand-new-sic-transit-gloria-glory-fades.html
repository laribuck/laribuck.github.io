Sic Transit Gloria ... Glory Fades performed by Brand New<br /><br />This is from the album Deja Entendu<br /><br /><br /><br />Keep the noise low.<br /><br />She doesn't wanna blow it.<br /><br />Shaking from head to toe<br /><br />while your left hand does &quot;the show me around.&quot;<br /><br />Quickens your heartbeat.<br /><br />It beats me straight into the ground.<br /><br /><br /><br />You don't recover from a night like this.<br /><br />A victim still lying in bed, completely motionless.<br /><br />A hand moves in the dark to a zipper.<br /><br />Hear a boy bracing tight against sheets barely whisper, <br /><br />&quot;This is so messed up.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />Upon arrival the guests had all stared.<br /><br />Dripping wet and clearly depressed,<br /><br />he'd headed straight for the stairs.<br /><br />No longer cool, but a boy in a stitch,<br /><br />unprepared for a life full of lies and failing relationships.<br /><br /><br /><br />(Up the stairs: the station where<br /><br />the act becomes the art of growing up.)<br /><br />He keeps his hands low.<br /><br />He doesn't wanna blow it.<br /><br />He's wet from head to toe and<br /><br />his eyes give her the up and the down.<br /><br />His stomach turns and he thinks of throwing up.<br /><br />But the body on the bed beckons forward<br /><br />and he starts growing up.<br /><br /><br /><br />The fever, the focus.<br /><br />The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell.<br /><br />Die young and save yourself.<br /><br />The tickle, the taste of...<br /><br />It used to be the reason I breathed, but now it's choking me up.<br /><br />Die young and save yourself.<br /><br /><br /><br />She hits the lights.<br /><br />This doesn't seem quite fair.<br /><br />Despite everything he learned from his friends,<br /><br />he doesn't feel so prepared.<br /><br />She's breathing quiet and smooth.<br /><br />He's gasping for air.<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;This is the first and last time,&quot; he says.<br /><br />She fakes a smile and presses her hips into his.<br /><br />He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides.<br /><br />He's holding back from telling her<br /><br />exactly what it really feels like.<br /><br /><br /><br />He is the lamb, she is the slaughter.<br /><br />She's moving way too fast, and all he wanted was to hold her.<br /><br />Nothing that he tells her is really having an effect.<br /><br />He whispers that he loves her,<br /><br />but she's probably only looking for sss...<br /><br /><br /><br />(Up the stairs: the station where<br /><br />the act becomes the art of growing up.)<br /><br />So much more than he could ever give.<br /><br />A life free of lies and a meaningful relationship.<br /><br />He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides.<br /><br />He waits for it to end<br /><br />and for the aching in his guts to subside.<br /><br /><br /><br />The fever, the focus.<br /><br />The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell.<br /><br />Die young and save yourself.<br /><br />The tickle, the taste of...<br /><br />It used to be the reason I breathed, but now it's choking me up.<br /><br />Die young and save yourself.<br /><br /><br /><br />Up the stairs: the station where<br /><br />the act becomes the art of growing up.<br /><br /><br /><br />The fever, the focus.<br /><br />The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell.<br /><br />Die young and save yourself.<br /><br />The tickle, the taste of...<br /><br />It used to be the reason I breathed, but now it's choking me up.<br /><br />Die young and save yourself.
