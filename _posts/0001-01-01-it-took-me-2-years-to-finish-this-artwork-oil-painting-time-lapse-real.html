Sharing the process of my oil painting &quot;Solace,&quot; a portrait with realistic water which took over 2 years to finally finish. <br /><br />I am an artist residing in sunny, warm [humid] florida! My paintings are heavily inspired by nature and its beauty. I work primarily in oil paint, and sometimes watercolor. I prefer to work in a mostly realistic style and occasionally experiment outside of that. I post oil painting time lapses, painting lessons and tutorials, drawings, art tips, and occasionally artist vlogs where I share bits of my life as an artist. Creating art is my greatest passion and I'm thankful for the chance to share it with you. ♥<br /><br />☾ My Links:<br />⋆ Patreon - I post real-time oil painting videos with voiceover of my oil painting techniques and process for several realistic paintings, royalty free art references of my own photography for you to use, postcards, q&amp;a podcast, and more!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/LenaDanya">http://patreon.com/LenaDanya</a><br /><br />⋆ Art Store- Original paintings and fine art prints available: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://lenadanyastore.com">http://lenadanyastore.com</a><br /><br />⋆ Instagram - works in progress, my art studio, and many more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/lenadanya">http://instagram.com/lenadanya</a><br /><br />⋆ Facebook - my official facebook art page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/LenaDanyaPage">http://www.facebook.com/LenaDanyaPage</a><br /><br />⋆ Tumblr: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://lenadanya.tumblr.com">http://lenadanya.tumblr.com</a><br /><br />Art Playlists of my channel and art videos:<br /><br />Oil painting time lapse / Speed painting:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKQ3ynSeXKJN28oqGjgAgzay9In_8cJg7">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKQ3ynSeXKJN28oqGjgAgzay9In_8cJg7</a><br /><br />Water Series | oil painting time lapses of my realistic, figurative, portrait paintings involving realistic water: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKQ3ynSeXKJNizJdvlfuKJaQYIjIoI0eu">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKQ3ynSeXKJNizJdvlfuKJaQYIjIoI0eu</a><br /><br />⋆ Sketchbook Sunday | Casual series where I paint and draw sketches in my moleskine sketchbook while and chatting with you about artist life and many topics of that nature: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKQ3ynSeXKJMT_fHbAYho0YccmmqmcjxZz">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKQ3ynSeXKJMT_fHbAYho0YccmmqmcjxZz</a><br /><br />⋆Learn to paint - Art help, oil painting tips, oil painting basics tutorials for beginners:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKQ3ynSeXKJN_BGvVsxmwV-Hyndu01BJ3">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKQ3ynSeXKJN_BGvVsxmwV-Hyndu01BJ3</a><br /><br />⋆Lena's Art Diary | Vlog series where I share some of my life as an artist.
