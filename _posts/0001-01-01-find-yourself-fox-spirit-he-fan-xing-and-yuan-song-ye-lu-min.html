Yes, both guys are foxes in this drama.<br /><br />Drama: Find yourself<br />You can watch the show on Netflix<br /><br />Everything belongs to drama, Hunan TV and Mango TV<br />I don't own anything. <br />People had no problem when YS lied and tricked HFX into their relationship and actually forgive everything YS does because he is handsome and FX loves him.<br />But they are mad and call HFX stupid when the YLM tricked and she wasn't aware.<br /><br />If a young fox like YS could trick her so easily, an experienced and old fox like YLM would be much easier. HFX is no where perfect. She is supposed to be an naive and inexperienced in love even she is 32 and successful at work. The original title of the drama is Senior girl 's 1st love- basically HFX still has a naive pure heart of a young girl even she is older. She only wants to date and experience love and it's not her fault that both guys are emotionally manipulative.<br /><br /><br />Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act<br />1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as<br />criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and<br />research.
