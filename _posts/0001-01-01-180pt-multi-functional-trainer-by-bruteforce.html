See the 180PT here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.renouffitnessequipment.com.au/equipment/cable-cross-overs/180ptt-s-functional-trainer-smith-machine-cross-over-cables-by-bruteforce/">https://www.renouffitnessequipment.com.au/equipment/cable-cross-overs/180ptt-s-functional-trainer-smith-machine-cross-over-cables-by-bruteforce/</a><br /><br />Our 180PT® is a cleverly designed “all in one” combination of the three major exercise structures (Smith machine, Twin Weight plate Functional Trainer and Power Rack) and allows you to keep up with and perform the latest exercise techniques and training programs as well as all the tried and true basics. When you purchase the 180PT you simple get three machines in one and with a very compact footprint. Also the 180PT® is designed to fit in the average height ceilings.<br /><br />This is a far superior machine in many ways to any other in its class. It has a true properly functioning cross over pulley system, with each pulley having its own weight resistance system. Other models have two pulley handles but both cables are connected to the same weight resistance system, making them virtually ineffective.<br /><br />Subscribe to the creator of this video for more great videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Matuestatue">https://www.youtube.com/user/Matuestatue</a>
