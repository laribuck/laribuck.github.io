California’s The Sentiments are back with another dose of sweet soul for all lovers of the low and slow. Following the acclaim of their last 45, the group has arrived with another Philly infused lovers lament. <br /><br />“What’s So Good About Saying Goodbye” enters like a classic soul record with a signature drums fill leading into heavy hits accompanied by violins, fuzz guitar, vibes, and lush horns arrangements. And to answer The Sentiments’ question, what’s so good about saying goodbye is knowing that after you do you can go to your local shop and grab this sweet seven inch. The song and arrangement, like the last, embodies so many elements that make up that sweet soulful sound that keeps reminding people why its better to smile now and cry later. Produced and recorded entirely at the incomparable Transistor Sound Studio, you’re gonna need doubles for sure. One for you....and one for your baby
