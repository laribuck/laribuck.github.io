A traditional family home is brought into the 21st century by designers Ashley Tracey and Laura McLellan of The Design Co. See how they transformed the dated home into a contemporary space with a white palette.<br /><br />Ashley and Laura used paint and oversized mirrors to make the rooms feel larger and brighter. In the living room, expansive windows allow natural light to fill the space. A baby grand piano gives the room a point of focus and bright artwork adds color. In the dining room, soft grey walls let the contemporary dining table and chairs steal the show, while a large oversized mirror expands the space. Wood walls in the office are a handsome contrast to the rest of the home. Ashley and Laura knocked down a dividing wall to create a modern open-concept kitchen that flows into the cozy family room.<br /><br />See the sources for the items in this video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://houseandhome.com/video/modern-makeover-classic-to-contemporary/">https://houseandhome.com/video/modern-makeover-classic-to-contemporary/</a><br /><br />----------<br /><br />MORE DESIGN INSPIRATION<br />Subscribe to H&amp;H's YouTube Channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/IZae51">https://goo.gl/IZae51</a><br />H&amp;H videos, product sources and more <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://houseandhome.com/tv">http://houseandhome.com/tv</a><br />Beautiful photo galleries <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://houseandhome.com/galleries/">https://houseandhome.com/galleries/</a><br /><br />----------<br /><br />CONNECT WITH HOUSE &amp; HOME!<br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/houseandhomemaga...">https://facebook.com/houseandhomemaga...</a><br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/houseandhomemag/">https://instagram.com/houseandhomemag/</a><br />Snapchat <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://snapchat.com/add/houseandhomemag">https://snapchat.com/add/houseandhomemag</a><br />Pinterest <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pinterest.com/houseandhome/">https://pinterest.com/houseandhome/</a><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/HouseandHome">https://twitter.com/HouseandHome</a>
