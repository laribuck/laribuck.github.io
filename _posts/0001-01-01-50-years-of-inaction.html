April 22, 2020 marks the 50th anniversary of earth day which means for the past 50 years people have been petitioning, marching, striking and urging world governments to take the climate crisis seriously. Unfortunately they still haven't. We celebrate the 50th anniversary of earth day by shedding  light on the inaction from the people in power and consequently the destruction of the planet they've allowed to occur.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pollutersout.org">https://pollutersout.org</a><br /><br />Editing and Videography: Theo Michel,  Joel Le-Tov<br />Script: Ayisha Siddiqa, El Wolhart, Isabella Fallahi<br />Research: Isabella Fallahi, Eric Damien, Ayisha Siddiqa<br />Narration: Kira Traylor
