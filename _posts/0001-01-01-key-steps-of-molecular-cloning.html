Molecular cloning is a process of isolation of a specific DNA fragment and transfer of this fragment into a plasmid vector.<br /><br />As a part of the plasmid vector, the DNA fragment could be easily amplified, sequenced, stored for long periods of time, and used for gene expression and other functional studies.<br /><br />Two starting ingredients of molecular cloning are a plasmid vector and a DNA fragment that has to be inserted in it.<br /><br />The DNA fragment is usually a gene or other functional region from a living cell, or it could be an artificial sequence with properties useful for a researcher.<br /><br />Plasmid vector is circular piece of DNA that could be easily amplified in E. coli, stored for long periods of time, and easily manipulated in a test tube.<br /><br />A typical plasmid vector contains:<br /><br />- an origin of replication that allows it to be replicated inside a bacterial cell;<br /><br />- a selection marker, for example a beta lactamase gene coding for ampicillin resistance;<br /><br />- and a multiple cloning site , which could be cleaved with several restriction enzymes, such as BamHI (G-GATCC), EcoRI (G-AATTC) or NcoI (C-CATGG).<br /><br />In many vectors, the multiple cloning site is surrounded by sequences of promoter and terminator, that guide expression of inserted genes after the vector is introduced inside a cell.<br /><br />To be used for molecular cloning, both vector and insert DNA are treated with restriction enzymes that cleave double stranded DNA molecules producing overhanging single stranded nucleotide tails.<br /><br />After their ends have been prepared with restriction enzymes, vector and insert are combined together, and another enzyme, called a DNA ligase is added to the mix.<br /><br />At the same time as complimentary base pairing of single stranded overhands brings the ends of vector and insert together, the DNA ligase fuses them into one intact DNA molecule.<br /><br />In order to make multiple copies of this molecule, the ligation mixture is introduced inside the E. coli cells in a process called transformation.<br /><br />During the transformation the cell-DNA mixture is kept on ice and then exposed to 42 oC.<br /><br />Such sudden change in temperature drives the DNA inside some of the E. coli cells.<br /><br />Then the cells are plated on a plate with growth medium supplemented with a selective antibiotic.<br /><br />Only the cells that acquired the plasmid have resistance to the antibiotic and are capable of growth on such a medium.<br /><br />After overnight incubation at 37 oC each transformed cell produces a colony of identical cells, oftentimes called a clone.<br /><br />The selected clones are then individually picked, grown even further in a liquid medium, and the DNA is extracted from them.<br /><br />Thus, in the process of molecular cloning, a DNA fragment that represented a tiny fraction of cell genome is integrated into a bacterial plasmid.<br /><br />As a part of a plasmid, this DNA fragment represents a quarter or more of total DNA in a test tube and it could be effortlessly and endlessly amplified in E. coli.
