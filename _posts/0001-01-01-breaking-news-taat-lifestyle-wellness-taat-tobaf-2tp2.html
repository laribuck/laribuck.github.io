BREAKING NEWS: TAAT LIFESTYLE &amp; WELLNESS (TAAT) (TOBAF) (2TP2) - NOVEMBER 17, 2020 - RICH TV LIVE -  TAAT LIFESTYLE &amp; WELLNESS LTD. (CSE: TAAT) (OTCQB: TOBAF) (FRANKFURT: 2TP2) (the “Company” or “Taat”) is pleased to reveal a lineup of video advertisements it has created for promotional initiatives which are currently underway for the upcoming launch of Taat in Ohio. As announced in the Company’s November 6, 2020 press release, in late October 2020 Taat began a USD $150,000 digital marketing campaign for its TryTaat landing page trytaat.com to encourage current tobacco smokers of legal age in Ohio to request a free sample of Taat Original , Smooth , or Menthol by mail. Taat product samples from TryTaat are available to current tobacco smokers of legal age anywhere in the continental United States. Since launching this campaign, which has only been partially completed as of this writing, the Company has received an average of more than 100 sample requests per day from smokers across the country, converting nearly one third of unique visits to TryTaat into confirmed requests, a rate considered exceptionally high for landing pages in any industry 1 . As part of these current initiatives, the Company has produced a series of video advertisements with an objective of attracting the attention of current smokers of legal age, cultivating awareness of the Taat brand name, and prompting requests for product samples on the TryTaat landing page. The video advertisements have been compiled into a “Promo Reel” format, which can be viewed below in this press release or on the Company’s YouTube channel. #taat #news #richtvlive<br /><br />Promo reel of Taat advertisements produced by the Company in Q4 2020 as part of its current digital marketing initiatives, which are already generating an average of more than 100 sample requests per day on the TryTaat landing page. <br /><br />Taat Chief Executive Officer Setti Coscarella commented, “Leading up to the official launch of our product, we are laying the groundwork to make the Taat brand highly memorable for current tobacco smokers of legal age. In just about every market segment, video marketing has often proven highly successful and cost-effective compared to other promotional methods. The proprietary informational videos we have released to date have gotten excellent feedback, which is why we’re doubling down on video as a key pillar of our marketing strategy. By using the moving image to show the product, demonstrate how it can be used by our target audience of current adult smokers, and convey what the Taat brand is all about, I am proud to release these video advertisements, and I look forward to seeing how they perform as part of our early-stage marketing and promotions.”<br /><br />The Company is also pleased to announce that its Chief Executive Officer Setti Coscarella has been appointed to Taat's board of directors (the “Board”). Between Mr. Coscarella's current capacity as a senior executive of the Company as well as his proven business acumen in investment banking, private equity, entrepreneurship, and a strategist position at a “Big Tobacco” firm, the Company believes Mr. Coscarella is a strong addition to the Board.<br /><br />TRADING ACADEMY JOIN HERE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://iM.Academy/corp/cjoin?enroller=richtvlive">https://iM.Academy/corp/cjoin?enroller=richtvlive</a><br /><br />YOUTUBE SUBSCRIBE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RICHTVLIVE">https://www.youtube.com/c/RICHTVLIVE</a><br /><br />www.richtvlive.com<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Richtvlive/">https://www.facebook.com/Richtvlive/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rich-de-sousa-51b32743?trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile">https://www.linkedin.com/in/rich-de-sousa-51b32743?trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/RichTVLive">https://twitter.com/RichTVLive</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rich_tv_live/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/rich_tv_live/?hl=en</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/richtvlive/">https://www.pinterest.com/richtvlive/</a><br /><br />Disclaimer<br /><br />Rich TV's company profiles and other investor relations materials, publications or presentations, including web content, are based on data obtained from sources we believe to be reliable but are not guaranteed as to accuracy and are not purported to be complete.
