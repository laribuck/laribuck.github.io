Note: A 12-hour time-telling system was used for numerical purposes in this section. In a 12-hour system, used in the United States and the UK, among other places, we distinguish between AM and PM times. We use AM for the first twelve hours of the day, then begin the 12-hour count again using PM for the second half of the day. Therefore, 1:00 PM in the 12-hour system corresponds to 13:00hr in the 24-hour system, 4:00 PM to 16:00hr, etc.<br /><br />Just like in any language, the task of telling time in English has its peculiarities and irregularities. Hopefully we can clear up any confusion about those irregularities in this section.<br /><br />As the video states, we use the word o’clock, which is really a contraction of the phrase of the clock, to describe any time which is a full hour.<br /><br />4:00 – It is four o’clock.<br />7:00 – It is seven o’clock.<br /><br />For times that fall between x:00 and x:30, we use the word past.<br /><br />4:14 – It is fourteen past four.<br />9:19 – It is nineteen past nine.<br />5:15 – It is a quarter past five.<br />1:30 – It is half past one.<br /><br />For times that fall between x:30 and the next full hour, we use the word to.<br /><br />9:40 – It is twenty to ten.<br />8:45 – It is a quarter to nine.<br />11:57 – It is three to midnight*.<br />4:35 – It is twenty-five to five.<br />*12:00 AM is called midnight since it is, conceivably, the middle of the night. At least it was back when people went to sleep when the sun went down.<br /><br />Common Time Expressions:<br /><br />Oftentimes, we use phrases to accompany our references to the time of day. Keep in mind that the times associated with each phrase are approximate and not concrete guidelines.<br /><br />In the morning – used until about midday (12:00 PM).<br /><br />Ex. I wake my husband up at six o’clock in the morning so he won’t be late for work.<br /><br />In the afternoon – used from about midday to 4:00 PM<br /><br />Ex. We usually leave work at about three (3:00 PM) in the afternoon.<br /><br />In the evening – used from about 5:00 PM to about 9:00 PM<br /><br />Ex. We always eat dinner at about half past seven in the evening.<br />At night – used from about 9:00 PM – 12:00 AM<br /><br />Ex. Our concerts begin at about ten o’clock at night.
