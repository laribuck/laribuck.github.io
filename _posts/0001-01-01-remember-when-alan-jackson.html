*** | I do not own this video |<br />Movie: Up (2009)<br /><br />Song: Remember when - Alan Jackson<br /><br />Lyrics: <br />Remember when I was young and so were you<br />and time stood still and love was all we knew<br />You were the first, so was I<br />We made love and then you cried<br />Remember when<br /><br />Remember when we vowed the vows<br />and walked the walk<br />Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard<br />We lived and learned, life threw curves<br />There was joy, there was hurt<br />Remember when<br /><br />Remember when old ones died and new were born<br />And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged<br />We came together, fell apart<br />And broke each other's hearts<br />Remember when<br /><br />Remember when the sound of little feet<br />was the music<br />We danced to week to week<br />Brought back the love, we found trust<br />Vowed we'd never give it up<br />Remember when<br /><br />Remember when thirty seemed so old<br />Now lookn' back it's just a steppin' stone<br />To where we are,<br />Where we've been<br />Said we'd do it all again<br />Remember when<br />Remember when we said when we turned gray<br />When the children grow up and move away<br />We won't be sad, we'll be glad<br />For all the life we've had<br />And we'll remember when
