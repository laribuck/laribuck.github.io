I use to think a million bucks was a fortune, then I became a millionaire and all of a sudden it doesn't' feel like much. Money is relative and if you keep chasing it thinking that it'll lead you to fulfillment and happiness you'll be massively disappointed because the only source of ultimate happiness comes from being present and choosing to enjoy every moment of every day. It's learning to reinvent yourself each and every day and not label yourself based on past behaviours or actions. I'd much rather be broke and enjoy my life rather than be rich and be a slave to money... but you can have both, you can have wealth, love and happiness once you realize you can become the architect of your life and take action.<br /><br />üí∞ [FREE]: Get Started Selling on Amazon with my 7-Part Video Training Series: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tatianajames.com/freetraining">http://tatianajames.com/freetraining</a><br /><br />üó£Ô∏è TALK TO ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA üëá<br /><br />Instagram ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/tatianajames26">http://www.instagram.com/tatianajames26</a><br />Facebook ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/tatianajames26/">https://www.facebook.com/tatianajames26/</a><br />Facebook Messenger ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://manychat.com/l1/tatianajames26">https://manychat.com/l1/tatianajames26</a><br />Website ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tatianajames.com">https://www.tatianajames.com</a><br /><br />üìö RECOMMENDED RESOURCES üëá<br /><br />[FREE[ - My top book recommendations for business and self-development: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tatianajames.com/freebooks">http://tatianajames.com/freebooks</a><br /><br />‚ñ∫ The #1 Amazon Training Course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tatianajames.com/asmbonuses">https://tatianajames.com/asmbonuses</a><br /><br />‚ñ∫ The #2 Amazon Training Course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tatianajames.com/mpsbonuses">https://tatianajames.com/mpsbonuses</a><br /><br />‚ñ∫ Affiliate marketing course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tatianajames.com/amm">https://tatianajames.com/amm</a><br /><br />‚ñ∫ Kindle publishing course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tatianajames.com/kmm">https://tatianajames.com/kmm</a><br /><br />‚ñ∫ Jungle Scout (product research and supplier database) get 30% off your first month: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tatianajames.com/junglescout">https://tatianajames.com/junglescout</a><br /><br />‚ñ∫ Helium 10 (advanced product research &amp; keyword tool) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tatianajames.com/helium10">https://tatianajames.com/helium10</a><br />50% off your first month use coupon code &quot;TATIANAJAMES&quot; <br />10% off all plans lifetime or the Annual plans coupon code &quot;TATIANAJAMES10&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: The information contained on this YouTube Channel and the resources available for download/viewing through this YouTube Channel are for educational and informational purposes only.<br /><br />This description may contain affiliate links.
