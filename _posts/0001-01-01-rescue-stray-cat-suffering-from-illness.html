Hello everyone...<br />I am Lily from Indonesia. Thank you for coming to my channel. On October 2019 I just returned to my homeland from United Arab Emirates. For more than 20 years I worked abroad In Abu Dhabi city. I love animals, there I feed stray cats on the streets every day. 10 to 20 cats I feed every day in around my apartment. And that‚Äôs all I use my personal money. And also I rescued two cats Clara and Toby from the streets. Until finally Clara gave birth to 5 cutes kittens. Now in my homeland I‚Äôm continue my mission to help abandoned animals who need help. In the past I did not need anyone‚Äôs help, because I had money because I had a job. But now I need your help guys..<br />I don‚Äôt want to set up a PayPal account and ask donation to you guys!. Because I know you guys aren‚Äôt all rich people and have a lots of money. I just want to ask you a favor just by using your fingers. By supporting this channel. By subscribe, like, comment and share the videos I‚Äôm sure all of you can do it. Because this is free!! And you won‚Äôt lose anything if you do it. Without your help I cannot do anything to help them. Please.. help me to realize my dream. I don‚Äôt dream of becoming a rich person, because I won‚Äôt carry it when I die. My dream are very simple, I just want the rest of my life to be useful to others. Not only for humans but to animals as well. Remember guys... Their lives are dependent on your fingers.

Here I want to explain a little about cats that have short tails(bobtails). In my country Indonesia, short-tailed cat it's common.We will see many short-tailed cats here, which may be due to genetic factors. So it's not because it's broken or someone abusing it.<br />They have short tails since they birth.<br />=====================================================<br />Social Media :<br />Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/lilyindrawat82">https://www.youtube.com/user/lilyindrawat82</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ivolily">https://www.instagram.com/ivolily</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/lee.elsayed">https://www.facebook.com/lee.elsayed</a><br />=====================================================<br /><br />#rescue <br />#catlover <br />#animallovers <br />#straycat <br />#suffering <br />#illness <br />#skinny <br />#kitten
