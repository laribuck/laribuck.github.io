Turnout this election is projected to be the highest in a century, and voters are doing everything they can to make their voices count. Waiting in line for hours (even if you’re the mayor). Voting in person despite the pandemic because you fear that your mail-in ballot could be one of the 1.02 million that might be discarded. And casting a ballot despite the potential that someone with a semiautomatic rifle will be watching you at your polling place.<br /><br />But, does voting have to be so … hard?<br /><br />Not really. Just watch the video above and you’ll see it’s not like this in other democratic countries around the world. Voting in other democracies is a snap. And, if you’re really lucky, you might score a “democracy sausage.”<br /><br />When we showed voters from around the world what American elections are like in practice, they weren’t impressed. But they were impressed with our resilience and determination. So, while the world’s “oldest democracy” may be a bit creaky these days, let’s be clear: Go vote! That’s really the best way to make a change.<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n">http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n</a><br /><br />More from The New York Times Video:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://nytimes.com/video">http://nytimes.com/video</a><br /><br />----------<br /><br />Whether it's reporting on conflicts abroad and political divisions at home, or covering the latest style trends and scientific developments, New York Times video journalists provide a revealing and unforgettable view of the world.
