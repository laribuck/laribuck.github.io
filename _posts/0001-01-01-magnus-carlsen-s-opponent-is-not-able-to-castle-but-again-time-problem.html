In the opening Magnus Carlsen's opponent is not able to castle. In the mid-game, though Magnus Carlsen has less time than his opponent, he puts pressure on by not letting them to castle. As the game closes to the end, both sides are short on time and Magnus saying &quot;My technique is abysmal. I am just too slow&quot; leads to a very exciting end-game!<br /><br />Do you want to play chess with World Chess Champion?
