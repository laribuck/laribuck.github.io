Hello everyone! This week I sang Be Prepared from Lion King!<br /><br />Here’s another Elton John song coming at ya. This was supposed to be up a week ago but sometimes stuff gets all shuffled around, yknow? Either way, here is the final version of Be Prepared which will be on streaming sites so please listen to it and help me grow an empire! <br /><br />Did you guys see the Lion King movie? Did you like it? I watched a lot of the clips released on YouTube but my thoughts are a little iffy. For the first time, I really don’t have complaints with the vocalists. Most of them sing beautifully which is such a blessing for my lil ears. The animation is what I got caught up on but I’d love to hear your thoughts nonetheless. Should I dish out the cash and see the movie? The choice is yours. <br /><br />As always, a special thanks to PalmMute for arranging, mixing and just putting up with my shenanigans in general. He’s a true bro. Also to every back-up vocalist who sacrificed their time to turn into the ultimate Hyena choir. I am truly greatful. <br /><br /><br />I hope you all enjoyed this cover. I’ve been working on a lot of stuff this month that I’m so excited for you folks to hear! As always, thank you all so much for your continued love and support! I hope you have a fantastic week and I’ll see you all Saturday. (Or maybe Wednesday bc there might be a bonus upload)<br />♥<br /><br />Be Prepared - Lion King<br /><br />➤ Artwork: Sevil-s [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.deviantart.com/sevil-s">https://www.deviantart.com/sevil-s</a> + <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/zevil.s/">https://www.instagram.com/zevil.s/</a> + <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEPUFC1tz9Tw_Hx7rfBzfCw?view_as=subscriber]">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEPUFC1tz9Tw_Hx7rfBzfCw?view_as=subscriber]</a><br /><br />➤Instrumental/Arrangement - PalmMute [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/palmmuteaudio]">https://twitter.com/palmmuteaudio]</a><br /><br />➤BG Vocals: <br />Badger: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SuperBlueBadger">https://twitter.com/SuperBlueBadger</a><br />Raku: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/RakuMugetsu">https://www.youtube.com/user/RakuMugetsu</a><br />June Dark: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://junedark.com/">https://junedark.com/</a><br />Kimi: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kim5805">https://www.youtube.com/user/kim5805</a><br />Essenger: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MusicSunroof">https://www.youtube.com/user/MusicSunroof</a><br />Raayo: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/RaayoSings">https://www.youtube.com/user/RaayoSings</a><br /><br />➤Main Vocals: Anna - that’s me! <br /><br /><br />I only own my voice!
