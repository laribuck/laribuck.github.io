Too often I find myself defaulting to the phrase &quot;thank you&quot; when thanking someone for something. And I'm willing to bet you do too. This isn't insidious but the more it becomes a default habit, the less you and I are likely to think and mean the words we're actually saying. In a way, it defeats the purpose from even saying those two words. Instead, what we should all aim to do is vary the ways in which we say thank you. There are benefits to doing so that will reverberate in your life. Firstly, it'll make you more grateful and gratitude in one's life has proven to have huge positive effects. Secondly, it'll force you to be more present and aware. Huge benefit to your life. And thirdly, it makes you have to be creative. As artists, isn't that a good thing? I certainly think so!  Join me for this lesson and afterwards share three new ways for you to say thank you in the comment section. Hit me up on social media @PhilSvitek if it's easier. I'd love to hear from you.
