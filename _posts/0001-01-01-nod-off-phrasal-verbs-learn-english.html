Native English speakers use them frequently. Phrasal verbs are usually difficult to understand from their words alone, however, and many of them are idiomatic expressions.<br />To learn phrasal verbs, you must learn them as you would learn any new vocabulary. Practice using this phrasal verb until it becomes part of your own language. Once the phrasal verb is in your active vocabulary, you will be able to use it as a native uses it.<br />If you want to pass an exam such as the Cambridge Proficiency Exam (CPE), you will need to learn as many phrasal verbs as possible. You can find a lot more of my phrasal verb material at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://britlish.com">https://britlish.com</a>  and will particularly enjoy the English Activation Packs which are entire courses in one pack.<br />Pay What You Want.
