What is the oldest structure in Minecraft? How old are dungeons and trees? When did the End City or the Village come into the game? This video answers these questions, and much more! Let's compare the oldest structures in Minecraft!<br /><br />I basically compare all generated Minecraft structures in this video, in addition to a sample of natural structures, e.g., trees, and player-manufactured structures, e.g., the nether portal. I excluded terrain features like caves, ravines, lakes, and similar, which some might also describe as structures.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I did my best at researching, but the data may still be incorrect or faulty. The age values will also change over time.<br /><br />Sources:<br />â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ijaminecraft.com/sources/oldest-structures-comparison-2020">https://ijaminecraft.com/sources/oldest-structures-comparison-2020</a><br /><br />This comparison video is a bit smaller as I'm currently super busy with my studies, but I still wanted to get at least one video out this month! After I already compared the ages of blocks, mobs, and items in Minecraft, I thought it was finally time to compare Minecraft structures! I hope you enjoy it!<br /><br />Check out my other age comparison videos!<br />Mob Age: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/2EtD4gE0u-k">https://youtu.be/2EtD4gE0u-k</a><br />Item Age: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/m-3nrKyZtWQ">https://youtu.be/m-3nrKyZtWQ</a><br />Block Age: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/UX-f-iB8__g">https://youtu.be/UX-f-iB8__g</a><br /><br />#oldest #comparison #ija<br /><br />â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE and HIT THE ðŸ””!<br />â€¢ YOUTUBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/IJAMinecraft?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/IJAMinecraft?sub_confirmation=1</a> <br />â€¢ TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/IJAMinecraft">https://twitter.com/IJAMinecraft</a><br /><br />ðŸŽµ Music by C418<br />Songs in order: Sweden, Alpha<br />Volume &quot;Alpha&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-alpha">https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-alpha</a><br />Volume &quot;Beta&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-beta">https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-beta</a><br />License: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://c418.org/2017/01/26/what-am-i-allowed-to-do-with-daniels-music/">https://c418.org/2017/01/26/what-am-i-allowed-to-do-with-daniels-music/</a><br /><br />â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬
