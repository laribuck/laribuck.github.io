The COVID-19 pandemic is prompting more people to cook at home this Thanksgiving. Typically, there are more than 1,400 cooking fires on the holiday, and that number is expected to increase this year. Grease fires are the number one accident, said James Hickman of the Nassau County Fire Department in New York. And putting out the fire the wrong way can just make them worse. Instead of water, it’s best to put a pot lid over a grease fire or use a fire extinguisher to put it out, Hickman said.
