An attempt at some live dub with the DFAM (drums), Subharmonicon (stabs), Mother 32 (bass), Matriarch (keys), and – of course – the Re-201 Space Echo on delays.<br /><br />Some additional reverb is provided by the Intellijel SpringRay2 + Worng Electronics LRMSMSLR.<br /><br />Recorded and mixed live through a SoundCraft MTK-12. Some mastering (EQ, Compression) was done post-recording in Ableton Live.
