Recorded live at Birdâ€™s Basement on 14.12.19<br /><br />Jarrod Lawson is a composer, keyboardist, and singer who is inspired by Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway. Like those legends, he incorporates social and spiritual messages into his uplifting sound. His chops suggest a broad range of musical knowledge, including artists with a deeper connection to Jazz; as a vocalist alone, he has been favourably compared to Al Jarreau and Mark Murphy. <br /><br />Lineup:<br />Jarrod Lawson<br />Chris Friesen - Bass<br />Cory Limuaco - Drums<br />Trent Baarspul - Guitar<br /><br />For upcoming shows, visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://birdsbasement.com">https://birdsbasement.com</a>
