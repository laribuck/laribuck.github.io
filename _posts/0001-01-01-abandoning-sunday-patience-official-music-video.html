What's a few more years? <br />I'll do fine on my own somehow. Don't worry about me. <br />And I can't find the words I need that tell me how I feel. <br />Convincing my heart that it's not my fault and praying none of this is real. <br /><br />I'd like to wake up and be gone, like a real bad memory. <br />Like a nightmare in a dream. <br />I'd love to open up my eyes and see you right there next to me, being all I'll ever need. <br /><br />And I can't keep this up for long and I won't even try. <br />To think that it only gets harder now but you won't ever see me cry. <br /><br />I'd like to wake up and be gone, like a real bad memory. <br />Like a nightmare in a dream. <br />I'd love to open up my eyes and see you right there next to me, being all I'll ever need. <br /><br />And don't you tell me it's all okay. <br />I can't hear a single word you say. <br />And I'll be the one that you won't forget. <br />And I'll make sure that you remember this. <br /><br />I'd like to wake up and be gone, like a real bad memory. <br />Like a nightmare in a dream. <br />I'd love to open up my eyes and see you right there next to me, being all I'll ever need. <br /><br />I'd like to wake up and be gone, like a real bad memory. <br />Like a nightmare in a dream. <br />I'd love to open up my eyes and see you right there next to me, being all I'll ever need. <br /><br />Being all I'll ever need. <br /><br />I don't need you right now. <br />What's a few more years?<br /><br /><br />For Abandoning Sunday:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/abandoningsunday">https://www.facebook.com/abandoningsunday</a><br />Purevolume: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.purevolume.com/abandoningsunday">http://www.purevolume.com/abandoningsunday</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/abandonsunday">http://www.twitter.com/abandonsunday</a><br />iTunes - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/abandoning-sunday/id388286025">https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/abandoning-sunday/id388286025</a><br /><br />For Axtravaganza Films:<br />Official Website: www.axtravaganzafilms.com<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Axtravaganza-Films/171258122884953">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Axtravaganza-Films/171258122884953</a><br />Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/AxtravaganzaFilms?feature=mhee">http://www.youtube.com/user/AxtravaganzaFilms?feature=mhee</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/Jeff_AXFilms">http://twitter.com/Jeff_AXFilms</a><br />Tumblr: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://axtravaganzafilms.tumblr.com/">http://axtravaganzafilms.tumblr.com/</a><br /><br />Crew:<br />Produced by: Angel Alfonso and Jeffrey Moore<br />Written by: Jeffrey Moore and Angel Alfonso<br />Directed by: Jeffrey Moore<br />1st Assistant Director: Angel Alfonso<br />Camera and Lighting: Jeffrey Moore and Angel Alfonso<br />Production Design: Jeffrey Moore and Angel Alfonso<br />Edited by: Jeffrey Moore<br />Colored by: Angel Alfonso<br /><br />Huge thanks to all the wonderful actors that were involved with this project, and a big thank to Anthony Cosmano for allowing us to use his driveway.
