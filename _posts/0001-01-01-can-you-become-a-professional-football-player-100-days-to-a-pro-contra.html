What does it take to become a professional football player and can anyone do it? Today we talk to Nick Humphries from Train Effective who gave up everything he had and tried to become a professional football player. That's an outlandish dream in itself but Nick tried to accomplish becoming a professional football player in 100 days. He left his home in Australia, quit his well paying job, left family and friends behind to pursue his dream of becoming a professional football player. He wanted to emulate the success of the likes of Jaime  Vardy who also began his life as a professional football player at a relatively late period of his life. The goal was to get a professional contract in 100 days but while he might not have succeeded in becoming a professional football player in that short amount of time, the learnings he got along the way he hopes will aspire young football players to pursue their goals and achieve their dreams. <br /><br /><br />If you want to know how you can become a better football player and maybe one day become a professional football player, then say watch this playlist: <br /><br />Make sure that you're subscribed to unisport's YouTube channel for some awesome  videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5SQGzkWyQSW_fe-URgq7xw?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5SQGzkWyQSW_fe-URgq7xw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />If you contribute with subtitles, titles or descriptions leave your name here, and we will make sure that the world knows who helped grow the unisportlife experience! <br /><br />FOLLOW US ON SNAPCHAT! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://snapchat.com/add/unisportlife">http://snapchat.com/add/unisportlife</a><br /><br />Our homepage and store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.unisportstore.com/">http://www.unisportstore.com/</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/unisportlife">https://twitter.com/unisportlife</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/Unisportstore">http://www.facebook.com/Unisportstore</a> <br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/unisportstore/">http://instagram.com/unisportstore/</a>
