Airborne LIDAR is an optical remote sensing tool that uses laser pulses to measure the precise distance to the ground. The airplane-mounted laser range-finding system, transmits and receives data, which are precisely located using a highly sensitive GPS receiver. Computer-generated images reveal hidden faults not seen through the vegetation. <br />This example uses U.S. Geological Survey lidar images taken near Lake Tahoe and reveals a previously unknown fault cross cutting moraines.<br />Animation by Jenda Johnson, Earth Sciences Animated<br />Lidar Images from U.S. Geological Survey.
