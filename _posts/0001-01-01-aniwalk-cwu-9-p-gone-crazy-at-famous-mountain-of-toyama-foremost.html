【FORZA ENGLISH CHANNEL】<br />Please check the link below.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNa-oTdrNk0ZqiSt-lUat5g/videos">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNa-oTdrNk0ZqiSt-lUat5g/videos</a><br /><br /><br />There is a vintage shop, that I always wanted to visit from before we started Anisampo , is in Toyama. The name of the shop is FOREMOST Toyama. I still wear an USN peacoat with 10 buttons that I purchased online 10 years ago from this shop. In these days, I became such a French vintage obsessed bastard, so I need to be back to origin where I got into with vintage clothing from U.S.<br /><br />Stay tuned, and click to watch the movie below. Yoroshiku please!<br /><br /> <br /><br />Toyama is known for medicine peddlers, but to me, Toyama is all about FOREMOST. Of course, we can not forget about winter Japanese yellowtail in this season.<br /><br /><br />That famous shop is at local retro shopping street named &quot;Sampolo&quot;. I mean, &quot;Sampolo&quot;? Isn't this destiny? He is the owner, Mr. Nemoto. Me and Mr. Nemoto are standing up at Sampolo right there!<br /><br /><br />Mr. Nemoto has a vibe. He goes to U.S. every month for buying. <br /><br />The man with side-parted hair talks amazingly softly. This man is dope!<br /><br /><br />The store, where has the biggest area on Anisampo history, carries various kinds of classic American vintage items. Look! There are tons of badass Patagonia jackets from 80s to 90s. How crazy!<br /><br /><br />Glissade is the masterpiece out of all. I love my reversible one in light gray, but this pattern is also dope. It is in great condition too.<br /><br /><br />There are many mint-conditioned American military items here. Items are such as army pants from Vietnam War, bakers pants, Gore-Tex parkas, and so forth. The prices are surprisingly reasonable. <br /><br /><br />They even carry CWU-9/P. This great jacket was originally made as a liner, but you can wear it as an outer.<br /><br /><br />I finally meet this guy, USN peacoat with 10 buttons 13 stars on. This is the best of the best. This makes me go Toyama's banana. If the 10 buttons peacoat that I already have was the best, this one could be even better than &quot;the best&quot;. The body length is long enough, the pockets have flaps, and the collars are made bit smaller. This coat turns me on!<br /><br /><br />The shape of the collar is cool too. After I saw tremendous kinds of vintage stuff from all over the world, I returned to origin and reaffirmed how great American vintages are. What comes next? To be continued in vol.2! <br /><br /><br />【Today's feature 】<br /><br />FOREMOST TOYAMA<br /><br />1-3-13 Chuo Dori Toyama city Toyama ken<br /><br />Open 12:00 - 19:00<br /><br />Closed on Tuesday and Wednesday (Open if it is a holiday)<br /><br />Official website　<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://foremost.jp/">https://foremost.jp/</a>  Official Instagram　<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/foremosttoyama/">https://www.instagram.com/foremosttoyama/</a><br /><br />FOREMOST Toyama<br /><br /><br />【フォルツァのSNSでモア気絶】<br />YouTube👉<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2MPFuAv">https://bit.ly/2MPFuAv</a>  <br />instagram👉<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2BmiSSV">https://bit.ly/2BmiSSV</a>  <br />FB👉<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2puHaYp">https://bit.ly/2puHaYp</a>  <br />Twitter👉<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2prxw8W">https://bit.ly/2prxw8W</a>  <br />Mail magazine👉<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2IZHLrS">https://bit.ly/2IZHLrS</a>
