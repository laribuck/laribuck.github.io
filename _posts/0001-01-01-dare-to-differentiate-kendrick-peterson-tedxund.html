As an Undergraduate Admissions Coordinator at Notre Dame, sophomore Kendrick Peterson knows all too well how students like to portray themselves in the best light to impress future schools, employers, alumni, fellow peers, and others whom they meet. Most people, not only college applicants, seem to do the same in their daily lives. Unfortunately, this often entails hiding certain traits that are essential to one’s character in order to avoid discrimination. In his talk, Kendrick will argue that regardless of your classifications, you should always treasure what makes you unique. While daring the audience to “differentiate,” he will show the importance of celebrating diversity in all forms and encourage listeners to stop trying to fit molds set by others. Sophomore, Political Science at the University of Notre Dame This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
