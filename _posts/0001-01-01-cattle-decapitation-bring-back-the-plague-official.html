The cover art says it all, a stooped, skeletal Grim Reaper carrying the burnt-out husk of our planet on his back. &quot;The core concept of this record is humanity's insignificance despite what we've convinced ourselves,&quot; explains vocalist Travis Ryan. &quot;That's kind of why this album cover takes place in space, to remind you that 'the universe always finds a way to purge'. In the grand scheme of things, our species is merely a fleeting thought.&quot; Backing this up with a ferocious soundtrack, it's one of the most shocking and unflinching records of 2019, demanding an emotional response, and forcing people to think about their own contributions to the devastation of the planet.<br /><br />As the band prepares to tour and hopefully reach places they have yet play, what Ryan wants listeners to take away from Death Atlas is clear: &quot;I want people to be shocked into thinking more about their futures, their loved ones, the pain they're potentially subjecting their future generations to. Everyone just seems to live in the now with no care for tomorrow and that's incorrect thinking as far as today goes. Don't make tomorrow a cancelled check.&quot;<br /><br />LYRICS:<br />Yersinia Pestis!<br />The recurring pandemic<br />Not often enough it seems<br />For these mammalian hosts a systematic invasion is a must<br /><br />These scattering rats<br />Their diseased existence<br />Earth’s megalopoli a plague focus<br />Eradicated with Death’s persistence<br /><br />The density of the populace intensifies and modernized<br />The wrath of “god” bleeds from their eyes<br />…and like the raven this contagion keeps repeating, ever eating<br />humanity to nevermore<br /><br />Every body a host<br />Every body infected<br />Corpses white as a ghost<br />Naturally selected<br /><br />Black Death, you’ve found us<br />Your cloak surrounds us<br />Boundlessly drown us<br />in bacillus countless<br /><br />Bring back the plague<br />Delete those that threaten a new world<br />Start today<br />Dig their graves<br /><br />They’ll find a way to rid the world of finding new tomorrows<br />End of days<br />Dig those graves<br /><br />Bring back the plague<br />Even if it means your own survival is at stake<br />Dig your grave<br /><br />We’ll find a way to rid the world of everyone tomorrow<br />End of days<br />Dig our grave<br /><br />Malignant<br />Virulent<br />Mephitic<br />Anthropomorphic<br /><br />Pneumonic<br />Septicemic<br />Bubonic<br />Anthropologic
