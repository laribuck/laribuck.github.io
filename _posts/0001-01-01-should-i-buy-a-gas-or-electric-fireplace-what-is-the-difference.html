In this video we will discuss the pros and the cons between choosing a gas fireplace or an electric fireplace. Lets talk about some of the benefits for having or choosing one or the other. First off both electric and gas fireplaces are a great addition to your home! <br /><br />Lets start with the benefits of a gas fireplace: First off, gas fireplaces have and use real fire. Anytime you are using real fire they produce a lot of heat, so gas fireplaces are great heaters! Also being real, they have a much better look, and the flames are much more realistic and resembling a real gas fireplace. Now to the bad, gas fireplaces are usually more expensive because there is a lot more to them. Also they are usually larger and have a much more complicated install process. They also in most cases require venting, which can be difficult to install in a basement for example. <br /><br />     Now on to electric fireplaces. First off, lets start with the good. Electric fireplaces are naturally more affordable (because there is a lot less to them). Also they are much easier to install, being that really the only thing that they need is electrical ran to them, and are small enough to fit into a wall usually. And lastly this is a good and bad, they dont heat if you don't want them to. So you can run them in warm climates, and in the summertime. <br /><br />The bad: Being cheaper, easier to install comes with a cost... and that is they simply cannot replicate a real fireplace. And that is the number 1 drawback to electric fireplaces is the look. Secondly is they cannot generate the heating power of a gas fireplace. Again sometimes this can be considered a good thing in the right climate.<br /><br />So there you go, if your interested in browsing some of our products.
