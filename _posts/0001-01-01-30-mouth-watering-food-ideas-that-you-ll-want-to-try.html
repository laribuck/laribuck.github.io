AMAZING FOOD IDEAS AND RECIPES THAT WILL MAKE YOU DROOL<br /><br /><br /><br />Are you looking for ways to make your recipes even tastier? In this video, I show you simple ideas from the best chefs. <br /><br />I show you how to make delicious flavored ice-cream using skittles. You simply separate them in different colors, and you mash them up in the blender. Then, you add the mixture in some vanilla ice-cream, and finally, you layer it in a container. <br /><br />If you’re having a party with some of your friends over, simply pour some coca-cola with some gelatin. Then pour the mixture in an ice-tray and serve to your guests. <br /><br />Another great ice-lollies idea is to mix some gummy bears with some sprite and then freeze them. Then serve them to your friends. <br /><br />I show you the simplest cookie recipe using melted chocolate and flour. <br /><br />You can also use melted chocolate to make chocolate noodle bases and fill them with whipped cream on top. Simply, fill a glass with cold water and melt some chocolate.
