** Here's some of my thoughts on the Ideal combines so far, now keep in mind what works for me might not work for you and that's ok. ðŸ™‚<br /><br />** We like the Ideals when they are running, they preform well for us in terms of cleaning, separation,  spreading, unload speeds, and losses. We struggle with some thrashing sometimes in getting out white caps out, and increased noise in tough conditions... Also we find them to be built too lightly - even tho they are a heavy combine. <br /><br />** We also like the reduced amount fuel burn, compared to the John Deere S690s that we ran, typically 2-3gal less per hour.<br /><br />** But, we are currently struggling with reliability issues with everything from sensors, to pieces flying off the combines, to everything else you can probably think of.. ðŸ¤·ðŸ˜‚  We/AGCO need to get to the bottom of this... So stay tuned for more updates to come.<br /><br />** I have enough videos uploaded to YouTube to keep us going for next couple weeks haha, so if you are interested in staying a little more up to date, than check me out on Patreon, as that's what I use for my social media account ðŸ™‚<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=25010547">https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=25010547</a>
