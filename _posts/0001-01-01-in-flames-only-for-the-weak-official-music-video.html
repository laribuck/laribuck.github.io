Behind, I fall behind<br /><br />And so I hear my voice again<br />The tale of the bitter man here I am<br />Shake the silence and hear what it says<br />The tranquil pride that become the lie<br /><br />Sell me to infection, it is only for the weak<br />No need for sympathy, the misery that is me<br /><br />Sell me to infection, it is only for the weak<br />On bleeding knees, I accept my fate<br /><br />Sell me to infection, it is only for the weak<br />No need for sympathy, the misery that is me<br /><br />Sell me to infection, it is only for the weak<br />On bleeding knees, I accept my fate
