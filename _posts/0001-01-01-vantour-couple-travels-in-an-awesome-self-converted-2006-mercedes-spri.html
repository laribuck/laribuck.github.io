Great self-made 2006 Mercedes Sprinter conversion into a rolling home<br /><br /><br />-- The Story:<br />Hi, we are Jess and Rob and we currently live in Prague, in the Czech Republic. <br />Before, we lived in Switzerland and we actually have met in Florida. We share the passion for travelling and <br />exploring new places and all together, we have visited 6 continents. Still, there is so much more we want to see <br />and this is why we are moving from backpacking to van life.<br /><br />We have bought a 2006 Mercedes Sprinter van and converted it for about a year. Now, we are almost done <br />and only fine tuning the last details.It really starts feeling like a little home on wheels and the first weekend<br />and vacation trips we went for only proved us that this is what we want to do.<br /><br />With the current situation, we had to change our original plans, but one way or the other, our new plan will <br />definitely include a lot of travelling and exploring. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-- Check them out:<br />         Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/chirpy_travellers/">https://www.instagram.com/chirpy_travellers/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-- The Project:<br />This Video is a part of our Project which is all about featuring great Vanonversions on both our Instagram and YouTube. <br />Make sure to check out all the other great conversions!<br /><br /> - Check us out on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AYTAdE">http://bit.ly/2AYTAdE</a><br /> - Check out the Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2S2rdoQ">http://bit.ly/2S2rdoQ</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />-- Have a look at our Merch:<br />        <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2FJAoVC">http://bit.ly/2FJAoVC</a>
