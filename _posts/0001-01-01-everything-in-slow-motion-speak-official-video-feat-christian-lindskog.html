A seed of faith that keeps me questioning. If I could see like you do, where would I be? <br /><br />Who would I be? Sometimes it isn't enough. But if I linger here for a while, you will only hear me speak. If I could hear you.<br /><br />Speak into our hearts, a song to shake the earth. Love will light the way that leads us home. There is something buried underneath this concrete floor. From a seed, fragile sprouts are pushing upwards. If I could see like you do, but I can't so I won't pretend. But I feel it. One day those sprouts are going to break through the surface.<br /><br />There's a question that connects us all. Is there more than life and death? And even though we all take different roads, it burns within our chests. I don't need the signs and wonders, no scientific proof. Speak to me. Speak into my heart, a song to shake the earth. Will I live forever? Or will I disappear? My mind is searching for answers. My heart saying it's never been so clear. <br /><br />Speak into our hearts, a song to shake my perfect world. Love will light the way that leads us home. <br /><br />Lyrics: Shane Ochsner / Christian Lindskog
