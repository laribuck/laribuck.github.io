Here's footage Jason J. Oxina (aka jigga ja$e)leading an orientation for the incoming class of freshmen at the University of Colorado. Little does he know, an old friend of his (played by D magic)has some un-finished business to take care of w/ jigga. Will jigga ja$e be able to finish his presentation or will D magic and his crazy antics get the best of him?
