LYRICS:<br /><br />They're picking up pieces of me<br /><br />While they're picking up pieces of you<br /><br />In a bag you will be before the day is over<br /><br />Were you looking for somewhere to be?<br /><br />Were you looking for someone to do?<br /><br />Stupid me to believe that I could trust in stupid you<br /><br /><br /><br />And on the back of my hand<br /><br />Were directions I could understand<br /><br />Now that old buzzer Johnnie Walker<br /><br />Has gone and ruined all our plans<br /><br />Our best made plans<br /><br /><br /><br />Don't leave me here to pass for time<br /><br />Without a map or road sign<br /><br />Don't leave me here my guiding light<br /><br />'Cause I, I...<br /><br /><br /><br />Wouldn't know where to begin<br /><br />I ask the Kings of Medicine<br /><br /><br /><br />They're picking up pieces of me<br /><br />While they're picking up pieces of you<br /><br />Lying on ice you will be before the day is over<br /><br />So case and point may be<br /><br />That you never thought it through<br /><br />Stupid me to believe I could depend on stupid you<br /><br /><br /><br />And on the tip of my tongue<br /><br />Were words that always came out wrong<br /><br />'Cause they were drowned in Southern Comfort<br /><br />And left to dry out in the sun<br /><br />The noon day sun<br /><br /><br /><br />Don't leave me here to pass for time<br /><br />Without a map or road sign<br /><br />Don't leave me here my guiding light<br /><br />'Cause I, I...<br /><br /><br /><br />Wouldn't know where to begin<br /><br />I ask the Kings of Medicine<br /><br />But it seems they've lost their powers<br /><br />Now all I'm left with is the hours<br /><br /><br /><br />Don't leave me here to pass for time<br /><br />Without a map or road sign<br /><br />Don't leave me here my guiding light<br /><br />'Cause I, I...<br /><br /><br /><br />Wouldn't know where to begin<br /><br />I ask the Kings of Medicine<br /><br />But it seems they've lost their powers<br /><br />Now all I'm left with is the hours<br /><br /><br /><br />Don't leave me here<br /><br />Don't leave me here<br /><br />Oh no
