7 Days In Alaska - Hollywood (Official Lyric Video)<br />&quot;Hollywood&quot; is the second song from 7 Days In Alaskas's upcoming album. <br /><br />&quot;This song talks about dreams. Broken dreams with a glimpse of hope. The funny thing about this song, is that it‚Äôs very much based on a true story. The cover was taken by Christer, on his phone while we were in Hollywood, working on our first album.<br />This song is almost a celebration of failure, and finding the strength to keep moving forward when things get tough.‚Äù <br />- 7 Days In Alaska<br /><br />üéµStream/Download here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://orcd.co/hollywood">https://orcd.co/hollywood</a><br /><br />‚ñ∫Follow 7 Days In Alaska here:<br />Youtube | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/7daysinAlaska">https://www.youtube.com/user/7daysinAlaska</a><br />Facebook | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/7diaofficial/">https://www.facebook.com/7diaofficial/</a><br />Instagram | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/7daysinalaska/">https://www.instagram.com/7daysinalaska/</a><br />Twitter | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/7DaysinAlaska">https://twitter.com/7DaysinAlaska</a><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The official channel for Rock/Metal label GAIN<br />Subscribe to get the latest music videos, lyric videos and audio videos from our releases<br />üîîSubscribe here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://radi.al/SubscribetoGAIN">http://radi.al/SubscribetoGAIN</a><br /><br />‚ñ∫Follow GAIN here:<br />Facebook | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/GainMusicOfficial/">https://www.facebook.com/GainMusicOfficial/</a><br />Instagram | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gainmusicofficial/">https://www.instagram.com/gainmusicofficial/</a><br />Home | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fifthislandmusic.se/">https://www.fifthislandmusic.se/</a><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />‚ñ∫Lyrics:<br />Am I losing it?<br />A muppet for the show and this illusionist.<br />A revolutionist, caught up in his own metropolis.<br />Broken promises was all I found here, lies despair was all that i found there.<br />But it's all I have to show for.<br /><br />I left to make it in LA<br />Aren't you proud?<br />No one's coming to save me<br />It's dragging me down.<br />Gotta get out of Hollywood.<br /><br />Whoa oh whoa oh whoah<br />Whoa oh whoa oh whoah<br /><br />I didn't wanna move on<br />But all I thought i i knew is long gone<br />I've come to realize that i've been so lost for all this time.<br /> But broken promises was all i found here, lies despair was all that i found there.<br />But it's all i have to show for.<br /><br />I left to make it in LA<br />Aren't you proud?<br />No one's coming to save me<br />Its dragging me down<br />Gotta get out of Hollywood<br /><br />Whoa oh whoa oh whoah<br />Whoa oh whoa oh whoah<br /><br />Gotta get out of Hollywood<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />#7DaysInAlaska<br />#7DIA<br />#Hollywood<br />#GAIN<br />#FifthIslandMusic
