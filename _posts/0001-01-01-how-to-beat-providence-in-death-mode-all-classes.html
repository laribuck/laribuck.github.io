I've received many requests to continue the boss guides since I took a break from them, and today I've decided to finally continue them. I've taken a different approach to the Boss guides this time around and have included all classes so it's more beneficial to all players. I'm starting things up with Providence and will continue with the rest of the post-moon lord bosses. Next time I'll include the buff potions in the video but for those curious, I'll list them below. <br /><br />Buff Potions:<br />★Holy Wrath Potion★                           ★ = Calamity Buffs              <br />★Profaned Rage Potion★<br />★Shattering Potion (Melee/Rogue)★<br />★Cadence★<br />★Fabsol's Vodka★<br />★Titan Scale★<br />Archery Potion (Ranger)<br />Summoning Potions (Summoner)<br />-Ironskin<br />-Regeneration<br />-Swiftness<br />-Endurance<br />-Lifeforce<br />-Ichor Flash<br /><br />Terraria outro music: (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds3hv...)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds3hv...)</a><br /><br />#Terraria
