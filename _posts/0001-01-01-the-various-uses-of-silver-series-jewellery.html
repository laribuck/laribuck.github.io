We shall publish one of these each week for at least the next 6 weeks and possibly longer covering silver’s different usages. Today we are going to focus on Jewellery.<br /><br />Jewellers, both professional and amateur, have used just about every type of metal in existence. While fashion trends using unique and trendy metals come and go, three jewellery metals have stood the test of time and continue to have a strong presence in modern jewellery. They are: Gold, Silver, and Platinum.<br /><br />These three metals and the alloys that utilize them are referred to as the ‘Noble Metals’.  Noble Metals have four properties in common:<br /><br />1. They are precious metals and are also used as currency (a store of value) because of their intrinsic value.<br />2. They are found worldwide, but not in large enough quantities to render them less valuable.<br />3. Their properties including malleability and corrosion resistance, lend themselves to jewellery making.<br />4. These metals are considered beautiful, sensuous, and glamorous, which increases their appeal. <br /><br />According to the Silver Institute, in 2015 some 226.5 million oz of silver was demanded for jewellery purposes - which represents a little over 19% of total physical demand for that year. The Institute also reported<br />“Globally, silver jewelry fabrication increased for the third consecutive year to post a fresh high at 226.5 Moz. This increase was largely achieved on the back of an impressive 16 percent rise from both India and Thailand, while North America posted a 5 percent annual increase.”<br /><br />Jewellery makers stamp silver pieces with the code that denotes which alloy of silver it is. For example, 925 is used to designate sterling silver and 958 is used for Britannia silver. When shopping for silver jewellery we advise that you inspect the piece carefully to determine which alloy was used.<br /><br />While all of these silver alloys actually contain at least some silver, some metal names can mislead you into thinking the metal contains silver. Nickel silver or German silver, for example, are alloys of nickel, zinc, and other metals. These metals look like silver, hence the name, but they do not actually contain any silver and are commonly found on sites such as EBay for example. The same is true of quicksilver, which is the ancient term given to mercury due to its appearance. While mercury does resemble liquid silver, it does not contain silver and is not seen in jewellery because it is harmful to your health.<br /><br />So that concludes our commentary on the use of Silver for jewellery. We hope it was useful and next week we shall publish the next in our series – Uses of Silver in Medicines.<br /><br />Please view our latest videos:<br /><br />Why Foreign Currency Reserves Are Important – A Beginners Guide<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/xjPlrI6AH7s">https://youtu.be/xjPlrI6AH7s</a><br /><br />Gold and Silver Update w/e 16th December 2016 <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ulTkoUYUoFA">https://youtu.be/ulTkoUYUoFA</a><br /><br />Ignore the Dollar Collapse Fear Mongering – Rants Illuminati Silver<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/5iOG7-_vvF0">https://youtu.be/5iOG7-_vvF0</a><br /><br />Gold nanotechnology and AMD - Blindness<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/jNry9Q8aaQs">https://youtu.be/jNry9Q8aaQs</a><br /><br />Fed raises Rates - More to Come - Gold and Silver prices fall<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/3NMz7kZf4eA">https://youtu.be/3NMz7kZf4eA</a><br /><br />Oil prices Jump 6% – Good News for Gold and Silver prices<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/yEPyvytaV5Y">https://youtu.be/yEPyvytaV5Y</a><br /><br />Why is Donald Trump upsetting the Chinese Bear?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/tB_f9yO9KsI">https://youtu.be/tB_f9yO9KsI</a><br /><br />FED, Gold, Silver, Interest rates and Markets 2016<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DhUGxJtDmiQ">https://youtu.be/DhUGxJtDmiQ</a><br /><br />Gold and Silver Update w/e 9th December 2016<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/1QX6134XbPU">https://youtu.be/1QX6134XbPU</a><br /><br />Why Silver May Outshine Gold (cont.)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/tWqrbebJuZ4">https://youtu.be/tWqrbebJuZ4</a><br /><br />ECB Extends QE but Tapers it – Gold prices rise in Euro terms.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DaOKkkEn-Ug">https://youtu.be/DaOKkkEn-Ug</a><br /><br />Financial Armageddon – The Final Days<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/CNl3RCMSpOo">https://youtu.be/CNl3RCMSpOo</a><br /><br />Could Italy set off a European Banking Crisis?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ANSWYrzgm6g">https://youtu.be/ANSWYrzgm6g</a><br /><br />Renzi Resigns - End of Europe? - How does Gold and Silver React?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/tnmv1EQC6rc">https://youtu.be/tnmv1EQC6rc</a><br /><br />What is the Gold to Silver Ratio and why is it important?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/0GBKnBDV3K4">https://youtu.be/0GBKnBDV3K4</a><br /><br />Why Silver may outshine Gold in 2017<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/uQuirIkQ3bE">https://youtu.be/uQuirIkQ3bE</a>
