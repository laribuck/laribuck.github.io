The Narrow Fabrics Institute defines narrow fabrics as textiles that are no more than 12 inches (300mm) in width and are made by weaving, knitting or braiding fibers or yarns with an edge to prevent unraveling. NFI works to support new technology, specifications and testing. The Division sells abrasion rods specified in ASTM D6770 and disseminates revenue to textile-related programs. The Narrow Fabrics Institute provides a network to exchange information, solve common problems and develop mutually beneficial relationships.<br /><br />Learn more about NFI membership here: IFAI.com/NarrowFabrics
