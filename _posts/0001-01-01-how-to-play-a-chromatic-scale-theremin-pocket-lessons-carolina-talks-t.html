Book a theremin lesson: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carolinaeyck.com/lessons">https://carolinaeyck.com/lessons</a><br /><br />The second Theremin Pocket Lesson is all about the Chromatic Scale. Did you know that there are actually 13 finger positions?<br />My 8-finger position technique counts with 5 extra positions to designate the half-step intervals in between every whole-step. You can use the these 13 positions to play a chromatic scale, minor scales, whole tone scales and modes. If you already learned the major scale, you may want to try your hand on some new scales!<br /><br />----<br /><br />WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carolinaeyck.com">https://carolinaeyck.com</a><br />PATREON: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/carolinaeyck">https://patreon.com/carolinaeyck</a><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/carolinaeyck">https://facebook.com/carolinaeyck</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CarolinaEyck">https://twitter.com/CarolinaEyck</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/carolinaeyck">https://instagram.com/carolinaeyck</a>
