And they will help you overcome the hurdles that are holding you back.  <br /><br />The best way to use one of our videos is to get clear on your goal and focus on it. Listen to a particular video for 21 days.  <br />21 days because Research shows that it takes 21 days to develop a habit and new beliefs..  So for if you ‘believe’ it will take you 21 days to change or form a new habit and to get rid of any debilitating and self-limiting beliefs.  From my experience, The great news is is that it won’t even take 21 days before you start to see results.  In fact, you most likely will see results and see things start to happen after just a couple days but please continue to listen for 21 days for best results.  This process is greatly enhanced when you can relax your body and quiet your mind prior to listening.<br /><br />These videos are a powerful way to reach the subconscious mind while bypassing critical awareness and logical reasoning. As you start to assimilate them, they will create a new neural network in your brain. Be consistent and listen to a particular video as often as possible for 21 days.  You don’t need to wear headphones but it is recommended.  It’s best not to listen to anything else while you are listening to these affirmations.  You can listen to multiple videos but it is best to focus on one particular area and avoid scattering and trying out other affirmation videos at the same time. For example, if losing weight is the most important target you have, put your energy in it and avoid listening to different affirmations in different topics. the best time to listen to these affirmations is just before drifting off to sleep at night, and just after waking in the morning before arising but really anytime that you can listen to them is great.<br /><br />If you can follow these instructions, your life will transform for the better.  As you listen to these affirmations, you will find yourself feeling more positive than before the video began.<br /><br />CAUTION: DO NOT LISTEN IF YOU HAVE HAD SEIZURES OR EPILEPSY. CONSULT YOUR PHYSICIAN IF IN DOUBT. NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR MEDICAL ADVICE. DO NOT LISTEN WHILE DRIVING OR OPERATING MACHINERY.<br /><br />Hope this video inspires and motivates you to take action.  :)<br /><br />I attract what I want effortlessly.<br />I now attract what I want effortlessly.<br />I attract the things that I desire effortlessly.<br />I now attract the things that I desire effortlessly.<br />I am now attracting the things that I desire effortlessly.<br />I am now attracting the things that I want effortlessly.<br />I choose to attract the things that I want effortlessly.<br />I choose to manifest the things that I want, into my life effortlessly.<br />When I think of something that I want, it comes into my life effortlessly.<br />When I think of something that I want, it shows up right away.
