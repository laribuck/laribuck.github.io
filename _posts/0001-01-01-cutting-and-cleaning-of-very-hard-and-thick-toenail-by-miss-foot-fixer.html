Thanks For Watching cutting and cleaning of very hard and thick toenail by miss foot fixer. 向内生长的脚趾甲<br />Hello this is Miss Foot Fixer again and in this video you will watch the removing a curled and thicken nail.<br />This patient went to a podiatrist two years ago and due to some reason they cut incorrectly and over<br />time it become really thick. So, he went to a nail spa and they said that they couldn;t do anything and<br />they couldn't cut it because it was so thick. And they didn'tt have any facility to look after it, in case it got<br />any infection. So, what we did was cut the nail back. And you can see that for a professional it is not<br />hard to cut. The issue with a thicken nail is, if we didn';t take care of it then it will grow longer and grow<br />thicker and it will become painful. Secondary it will add pressure on the nail bed and it can breakdown<br />the nail bed. So, its really important to have the nail cut back to make it comfortable and also reduce the<br />risks on any complications. You will think that only old people would have thicken and curled nails but<br />actually a lot of younger people have it too. So, don&amp;#39;t miss to dismiss a thicken nail at any age.
