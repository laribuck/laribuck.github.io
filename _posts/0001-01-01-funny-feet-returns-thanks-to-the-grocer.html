Beloved 1980s ice cream Funny Feet is returning to the UK's freezers - thanks to readers of The Grocer Magazine.<br />The Grocer's year-long Bring Back a Brand campaign has resulted in one resounding winner -- the strawberry-flavoured tootsie, rescued by brand owner Unilever after 20 years in deep freeze.<br />The Grocer's editor Adam Leyland reveals how consumers clamoured for the return of Funny Feet, and visits Unilever's factory in Portugal to find out how the ice cream was brought back to life.
