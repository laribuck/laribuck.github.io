How do Americans and native English speakers talk and get around? We often use phrasal verbs, which are two and three-word phrases learned from childhood that are naturally learned. <br /><br />This video is part 5 of an introductory free lesson for the English on the Street online ESL class. This lesson walks you through a local home and kitchen supply store in Fort Collins, CO. The owner of The Cupboard even took time to visit with us! <br /><br />This class is designed to teach common English phrasal verbs and other English vocabulary related to specific topics such as shopping, ordering food, and learning how to get around in the United States with certain words.<br /><br />👉Practice Quiz!
