We round-up the most disappointing computer parts of 2017, then put them all in one PC! This also includes our first-ever short film!<br />Ad: Buy Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut on Amazon <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/pygud5">https://goo.gl/pygud5</a> (or their standard Kryonaut on Amazon <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/8ySAVs)">https://goo.gl/8ySAVs)</a><br /><br />This PC build was concepted around Halloween of 2017: We wanted to build a &quot;Disappointment PC,&quot; which we thought should include the worst CPU, GPU, and case that we worked with this year. The concept was shelved, and eventually returned as a short film that then merged with a GN-styled rant.<br /><br />We have a new GN store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.gamersnexus.net/">https://store.gamersnexus.net/</a><br /><br />Like our content?

This is unrelated to the product manufacturer. Any advertisements or sponsorships are disclosed within the video (&quot;this video is brought to you by&quot;) and above the fold in the description. We do not ever produce paid content or &quot;sponsored content&quot; (meaning that the content is our idea and is not funded externally aside from whatever ad placement is in the beginning) and we do not ever charge manufacturers for coverage.
