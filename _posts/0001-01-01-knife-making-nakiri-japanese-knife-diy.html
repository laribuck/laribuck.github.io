Another Japanese Chef's knife! This shape is inspired by Nakiri knives typical Japanese-style vegetable knife but with a western full tang construction and a general utility bevel geometry. <br />The steel is 02 high carbon. Handle is made of ebony and teak (or oak, not sure) both aged well by a luthier and white vulcanized fiber liners.<br />The pins are all brass with the middle one in mosaic made by me in a previous ideo.<br /><br />Clarification:<br />With the words &quot;inspired by Nakiri knives&quot; I wanted to point out that this knife is not an actual nakiri. The handle construction, bevel geometry and thickness have pretty much nothing to do with traditional japanese knives. This knife has been made to be used as a general purpose knife, that's why is thicker than you might expect! <br /><br />I just started to list some of the stuff I use for my projects in this amazon storefront:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/blackbeardprojects">https://www.amazon.com/shop/blackbeardprojects</a><br />It's affiliate marketing, so if you order something from here you'll help the channel for free!
