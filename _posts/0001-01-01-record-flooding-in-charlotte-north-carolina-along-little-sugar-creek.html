Flood waters in Charlotte are reaching historic levels as more than four inches of rain fall across Mecklenburg County swelling rivers, creeks and streams.<br /><br /><br /><br />Little Sugar Creek near Midtown Park has reach a depth of 15.2 feet and climbing. That observation, recorded by instrumentation near Atrium Health's Carolina Medical Center, indicates the water level has passed the 1997 record set during Hurricane Danny.<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;Unless you were here in 1997, you have never seen the Little Sugar Creek flood like this near the medical center,&quot; WCNC Charlotte chief meteorologist Brad Panovich said. &quot;The greenway is almost overflowing.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />At 16 feet, the creek will enter &quot;moderate&quot; flood stage and continue to set a new flood record.<br /><br /><br /><br />This one spot is one of many areas flooding across Charlotte and Mecklenburg County, where the National Weather Service is continuing a Flash Flood Warning because of Thursday morning's heavy rainfall.<br /><br /><br /><br />Along Mallard Creek and David Taylor Drive, the Charlotte Fire Department evacuated 143 people from Corvian Community Elementary School because of flood waters. No injuries were reported.<br /><br /><br /><br />Stewart Creek at West Morehead Street is quickly approaching a record breaking, major flood stage. At 9:15 a.m., water had climbed just over the 17 feet mark. The record there stands at 18.6 feet and water was still rising. #CLTwx #NCwx<br /><br /><br /><br />FULL STORY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/weather/charlotte-flooding-rain-weather-record-historic-water/275-a2755bfd-62ea-4240-b8aa-58d89b067462">https://www.wcnc.com/article/weather/charlotte-flooding-rain-weather-record-historic-water/275-a2755bfd-62ea-4240-b8aa-58d89b067462</a>
