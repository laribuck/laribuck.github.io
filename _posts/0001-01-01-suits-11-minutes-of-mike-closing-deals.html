Adams) may not have graduated from law school, but he is one of the firm's most valuable assets. Watch Mike Ross do what he does best and get the job done.<br /><br />Synopsis: &quot;Suits&quot; delves into the fast-paced, high-stakes world of a top Manhattan corporate law firm where hotshot associate Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, &quot;Love &amp; Other Drugs&quot;) makes a risky move by hiring Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams, &quot;Old School&quot;) a brilliant but unmotivated college dropout, as his associate. As he becomes entangled in this unfamiliar world, Mike relies heavily on the firm's best paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markle, &quot;Horrible Bosses&quot;), and Harvey's no-nonsense assistant Donna (Sarah Rafferty, &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;) to help him serve justice. Mike proves to be a legal prodigy with a photographic memory and a hustler's street smarts despite the absence of bonafide legal credentials.
