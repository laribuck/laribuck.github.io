In the run up to the opening of the 30th Olympic Games of modern times, in London, the United Kingdom, from July 27 to August 12, UNESCO will host, on June 7, 2012, a first-ever pre-release screening of the documentary film &quot;The War on Doping.&quot; The film presents the first decades in the campaign against doping in sport.<br /><br /><br /><br />This is a trailer of the one hour documentary about the fight on doping in sports. It shows some of the faces involved and touches some of the issues that has been going on for more than 40 years. In this film, and for the first time, the world's most respected authority in the subject, the renown doping hunter, Professor Arne Ljungqvist, will guide us through all of them. The big scandals. The big names. The inside story. A mirror of society.<br /><br /><br /><br />More information: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/anti-doping/sv15/news/one_month_before_the_launch_of_the_london_olympics_unesco_hosts_the_pre_release_screening_of_the_film_the_war_on_doping/">http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/anti-doping/sv15/news/one_month_before_the_launch_of_the_london_olympics_unesco_hosts_the_pre_release_screening_of_the_film_the_war_on_doping/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Video copyright: Matin√© Film and Television (Sweden)
