The Armed Reconnaissance module is the newest addition to Rheinmetall’s lineup of Mission Master Autonomous - Unmanned Ground Vehicles (A-UGVs). Modular and versatile, the Mission Master family uses the Rheinmetall PATH autonomous kit (A-kit) to aid troops in a wide variety of operations. The Armed Reconnaissance A-UGV is equipped with both intel-gathering tech and Rheinmetall Fieldranger remote-controlled weapon system to gain tactical information and provide fire support when necessary, keeping a man in the loop at all times. The Mission Master – Armed Reconnaissance is designed to execute high-risk scouting missions and deliver real-time common operating picture without endangering soldiers. <br /><br /><br />- - - <br /><br />Learn more on the Rheinmetall Defence and Rheinmetall Canada websites:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rheinmetall.ca">https://www.rheinmetall.ca</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rheinmetall-defence.com/en/rheinmetall_defence/systems_and_products/unbemannte_fahrzeuge/mission_master/index.php">https://www.rheinmetall-defence.com/en/rheinmetall_defence/systems_and_products/unbemannte_fahrzeuge/mission_master/index.php</a> <br /> - - - <br />Imprint/Data protection: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rheinmetall-defence.com/imprint">https://www.rheinmetall-defence.com/imprint</a><br />- - -
