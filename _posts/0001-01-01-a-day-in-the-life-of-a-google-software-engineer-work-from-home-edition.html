Helloooo!<br /><br />This is my first video on the topic of Career - Job Shadowing where I follow people at work to learn more about what they do. My hope is that this video and the future ones will offer you a useful glimpse into the different career fields if you are considering them.<br /><br />In this video, I am following Neil Fraser - a senior software engineer at Google - to see what his typical workday looks like during COVID-19 quarantine where a lot of people have been working from home. The video also includes some of Neil's tips for aspired software engineers out there! <br />Besides being a software engineer, Neil also does a lot of cool projects, and occasionally, he'd upload videos of what he does on his channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Odo987.">https://www.youtube.com/user/Odo987.</a> Check it out!<br /><br />-------------------<br />Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bensound.com">https://www.bensound.com</a>
