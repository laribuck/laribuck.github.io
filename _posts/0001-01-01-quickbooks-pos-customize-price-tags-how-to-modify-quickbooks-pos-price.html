Pro users can also customize or create new tag templates to meet their individual needs.<br /><br />Tag printing is supported to compatible dedicated tag printers (e.g. the Zebra LP2824) and to standard inkjet/laser printers (using sheet labels). A dedicated tag printer allows you to print to hang tag, jewelry tag, and adhesive tag templates available on roll stock.<br /><br />QuickBooks POS Inventory Tags<br /><br />Tags can be printed with or without bar codes or the reference MSRP (manufacturer's suggested retail price).<br /><br />When printing tags with bar codes and using the default tag templates, QuickBooks Point of Sale uses the inventory item number to produce the bar code, not the UPC code. This allows you to print bar-coded tags and list items on documents by scanning them, even if you do not have a vendor-provided UPC code for the items. Learn more.<br /><br />The MSRP is included on printed tags if it has been entered on the item record. If you do not wish to include the MSRP, don't enter it on the item record or remove the field from the template you are using with Print Designer.<br /><br />See QuickBooks POS - integrating QuickBooks POS with QuickBooks financial part 1.<br /><br />Thanks for checking out our channel and tuning in to learn more about QuickBooks Point of Sale.<br /><br />--- only headquarters in QuickBooks POS can define group items  but all stores can sell group items (or list on other documents)..<br />subscribe for more QuickBooks!<br /><br />QuickBooks POS Customize Price Tags - How To Modify QuickBooks POS Price Tag<br /><br />a video on how to count and reconcile cash drawers in QuickBooks POS.
