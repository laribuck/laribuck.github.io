10 Celebs who are dating normal people.<br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/Hnoaw3">https://goo.gl/Hnoaw3</a><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />When you’re a celebrity, the whole world watches every move you make. This is even more true if you happen to be in a relationship. The world can’t get enough of Hollywood couples, but when they don’t seem to be in the same league, it leaves us scratching our heads. These are ten celebs who are way hotter than their partner.<br /><br />Fans of Salma Hayek saw the star wed her billionaire husband in 2009. Almost immediately people began to say the actress was a gold digger, mostly because her husband isn’t so lucky in the looks department. Even if that is the case, it obviously isn’t something that Salma worries about. The two have been together for a decade, and don’t show any signs of slowing down.<br /><br />Another couple that stunned us all was Mary-Kate Olsen and her French banker husband, Olivier Sarkozy. Everything about this couple seems to be off, from their height difference to their age difference. But, it seems to be working for the duo, despite headlines claiming Mary-Kate is too pretty for her older husband. <br /><br />Though we all know how the relationship ended between Anna Faris and Chris Pratt, when they first got together, people were raising eyebrows. Mostly because Anna was one of the most bankable leading ladies in Hollywood. But, over the years, the roles have reversed, and Chris Pratt has become the new Hollywood “It” man. Maybe that had something to do with their split in August 2017.<br /><br />Check this video out to see more stories like Hugh Jackman, Adriana Lima, Christina Hendricks, and more!
