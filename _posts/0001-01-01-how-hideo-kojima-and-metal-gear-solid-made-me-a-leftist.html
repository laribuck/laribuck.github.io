Hideo Kojima is the legendary auteur game director behind the Metal Gear Solid game. The franchise is over the top, crazy and surreal but it also has a core set of ideals that are consistent in every game. While the anti-nuclear weapons theme is the most prominent, the series also is anti-colonialism, anti-war and often pro-socialist. <br /><br />I break down how the series impacted my own politics and helped me break free from western centric views of history and politics. <br /><br />My Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/join/TheKavernacle">https://www.patreon.com/join/TheKavernacle</a><br /><br />My Unofficial Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.com/invite/WTjz5JNUss">https://discord.com/invite/WTjz5JNUss</a><br /><br />My Podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2g88k90PsIKnDxU39lU0qi?nd=1&amp;nd=1">https://open.spotify.com/show/2g88k90PsIKnDxU39lU0qi?nd=1&amp;nd=1</a><br /><br />My Subreddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheKavernacle/">https://www.reddit.com/r/TheKavernacle/</a><br /><br />My Personal Reddit:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tommycahil1995">https://www.reddit.com/user/tommycahil1995</a><br /><br />Follow me on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com//TheKavernacle">https://twitter.com//TheKavernacle</a><br /><br />My Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/thekavernacle/">https://instagram.com/thekavernacle/</a><br /><br />My Medium: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://medium.com/@thekavernacle">https://medium.com/@thekavernacle</a><br /><br />My Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thekavernacle.wordpress.com">https://thekavernacle.wordpress.com</a><br /><br />-<br />Eurogamer reporting: &quot;Legendary video game developer Hideo Kojima has confirmed a new project is in development, but has said nothing about it.<br /><br />In a statement issued on Kojima's official Twitter accounts and Kojima Productions' LinkedIn page, the Metal Gear creator said the studio was hiring for various roles at its Tokyo office.<br /><br />In 2015, Kojima Productions split from Konami, becoming an independent studio. It released its first game, Death Stranding, in 2019.<br /><br />Without any information on the new game from Kojima, we're left to speculate. Everything from Death Stranding 2 to a new Silent Hill has been rumoured since work wrapped up on Death Stranding.<br />-<br />Back in January 2020, Kojima suggested he was keen to work on multiple projects alongside his next &quot;big game&quot;, including manga, anime, episodic titles, and digital-only games.&quot;<br />-
