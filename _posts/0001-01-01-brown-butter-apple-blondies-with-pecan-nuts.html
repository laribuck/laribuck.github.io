Grease a 9*13- inch baking dish with cooking spray and line with Parchment paper, with sides hanging out, which will help you get the blondies out, after they get baked.<br />2) Add the Butter to a saucepan. Allow the Butter to melt over medium-low heat. As the Butter starts to melt, stir using a wire whisk or a spatula. The Butter will start to bubble, and get frothy. After about 3 minutes, the bubbling will stop. At this moment, stir again and your brown butter shall be ready. Take it out in a separate bowl and cool it down. It is advisable to do this step in a light-colored pan so that you can see the color of the butter changing. A dark-colored pan, will make it difficult to check the color of the butter, turning brown. (See video below for visual)<br />3) In the same pan, add chopped Apples.

Bake the Apple Blondies for 35 min.
