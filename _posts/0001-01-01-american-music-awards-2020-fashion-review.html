The American Music Awards 2020 was a whirlwind of fashion choices. Jennifer Lopez chose to wear an off the runway Balmain two piece set, which many said was less than flattering. Megan Thee Stallion appeared in Area, the budding young New York brand, and I'm hoping their relationship continues in the future! Doja Cat wore two different Vivienne Westwood looks, and while I can't truthfully say I loved them, I think it's a relationship I'm willing to keep my eye on. Maluma wore Thom Browne and while separately their both HOT, together I don't know what to do with myself. David Dobrik needs to step up his game, and I'm hoping he'll channel some Eastern European aesthetics with Balenciaga in the future. Billie Eilish is beginning to bore me, and I hope that in her next era, she stops giving us Missy Elliott reproductions and pivots her style to something a bit more original. BTS went from somber to Dynamite in two different suiting styles, and I wasn't totally mad! Overall, I wanted more, but willing to take what I'm getting.<br /><br />Those Mentioned:<br />24kGoldnBebe Rexha - Julien MacDonald<br />Billie Eilish - Skoot Apparel<br />BTS<br />Cara Delevigne - Dolce &amp; Gabbana + Dior<br />Ciara - Balmain<br />Dan Smyers<br />Shay Mooney<br />David Dobrik<br />Doja Cat - Vivienne Westwood by Andreas Kronthaler<br />Doja Cat - Vivienne Westwood by Andreas Kronthaler<br />Dua Lipa - Versace<br />Dua Lipa - Versace<br />Iann Dior<br />Jennifer Lopez - Balmain<br />Jennifer Lopez - LaQuan Smith<br />Katy Perry - Acne Studios<br />Lewis Capaldi - Vans<br />Lil Baby - Prada<br />Machine Gun Kelly - Balmain<br />Maluma - Thom Browne<br />Maluma<br />Megan Fox - Azzi &amp; Osta<br />Megan Thee Stallion - Area<br />Megan Thee Stallion<br />Taraji P.
