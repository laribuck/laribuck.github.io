European Philharmonic of Switzerland EPOS<br />Conductor John Fiore<br /><br />Live recorded by Swiss Radio Espace 2 on 1st September 2015 during EPOS' residency at Septembre Musical Montreux<br /><br />The European Philharmonic of Switzerland (EPOS) was the “Orchestra in Residence” and celebrated an extraordinary debut at the 70th Edition of the classical music festival `Septembre Musical` in Montreux 2015. It succeeded the residency of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and performed four symphonic concerts, assembling 94 top-level musicians from 24 different countries. While most of the EPOS members are holding permanent or trial positions in Europe’s leading symphony orchestras, Montreux`s unique environment enables them to realize an artistic work of sublime quality far away from their daily orchestra routine. The musicians are coming together in Montreux to continue the musical path and partnership they established during the last 15 years in the environment of the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra. <br /><br />www.europeanphilharmonic.com
