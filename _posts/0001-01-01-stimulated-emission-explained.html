And a huge thank you to all my existing patrons - you make these videos possible.<br /><br />In this video I describe the process of stimulated emission, and how it is mathematically the 'dual' process of absorption. I discuss how this relates to the absorption coefficient, and how we can have stimulated emission and absorption happening at the same time, depending on the number of electrons in each state.<br /><br />This is part of my graduate series on optoelectronics / photonics, and is based primarily on Coldren's book on Lasers as well as graduate-level coursework I have taken in the EECS department at UC Berkeley.<br /><br />Hope you found this video helpful, please post in the comments below anything I can do to improve future videos, or suggestions you have for future videos.
