In this video, I will prove the Residue Theorem, using results that were shown in the last video. Note that the theorem proved here applies to contour integrals around simple, closed curves.<br /><br />Any questions? Leave them in the comments below!<br /><br />Lecture Notes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_urJu4cgDhMd0NmUlpiLTU3WGc">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_urJu4cgDhMd0NmUlpiLTU3WGc</a><br /><br />Patreon Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=4354534">https://www.patreon.com/user?u=4354534</a><br /><br />CORRECTION: Just a note that the sum at 0:30 and 6:15 should start at j = 1. Annotations are gone now so my best bet is to update the description with corrections. Regardless, this is a fairly minor detail and shouldn't affect things too much.
