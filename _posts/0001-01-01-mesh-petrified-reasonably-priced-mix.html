Mesh - Petrified (Reasonably Priced Mix). My Hands Are Tied<br /><br /><br /><br />You're the breath in us too<br /><br />You're the test of what's true<br /><br />You're the one that stops them<br /><br />You become the problem<br /><br /><br /><br />It's just a different side<br /><br />Of the many walls in your mind<br /><br />The walls with secret panels<br /><br />Built with knives and hammers<br /><br /><br /><br />What a price to pay <br /><br /><br /><br />You're the pain I go through<br /><br />To get to where I need to<br /><br />You're the retribution<br /><br />A sordid institution<br /><br /><br /><br />It's just a different way<br /><br />Of &quot;saving face&quot;, as you say<br /><br />A face that spares no malice<br /><br />That drinks the poisoned chalice<br /><br /><br /><br />Petrified<br /><br />By what you've done - and you've just begun<br /><br />I hope you get your way<br /><br />But what a price to pay<br /><br />Petrified<br /><br />By what you've done - and you've just begun<br /><br />I hope you get your way<br /><br />But what a price to pay<br /><br /><br /><br />You take the falling rain<br /><br />You make the sun that dried it<br /><br />You shoulder all the blame<br /><br />You've got the strength to hide it<br /><br />Led emotion to the door<br /><br />Remind me who you were before<br /><br />(Petrified)<br /><br /><br /><br />You are the wheels in motion<br /><br />A wave of self-promotion<br /><br />You beat a different drum<br /><br />The rhythm's strong, but no fun<br /><br /><br /><br />You are the vengeful hand<br /><br />That tasted sweet, but so bland<br /><br />You are my one protection<br /><br />But you try to hard to get them<br /><br /><br /><br />(repeat chorus)<br /><br /><br /><br />You take the falling rain<br /><br />You make the sun that dried it<br /><br />You shoulder all the blame<br /><br />You've got the strength to hide it<br /><br />Led emotion to the door<br /><br />Remind me who you were before<br /><br /><br /><br />(repeat chorus)<br /><br /><br /><br />(Petrified)<br /><br />What a price to pay<br /><br />What a price to pay
