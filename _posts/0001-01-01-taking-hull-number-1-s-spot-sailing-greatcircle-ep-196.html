Being locked down again we watch the launch of Nr.1 live online from our yearly Ameland retreat and see how they move our Nr.4 to the assembly hall.<br /><br />This version of this episode includes world premiere footage I just received of the AST COAST 340 full carbon dinghy with jockey seat. I haven't even got the specs yet, more to follow in next episode.
