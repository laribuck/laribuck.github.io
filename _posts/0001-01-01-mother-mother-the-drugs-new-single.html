New Single from Mother Mother! (Lyrics in description)<br /><br />Mother Mother’s new album is scheduled for release in early 2017.<br /><br />Cause you’re hotter than the sun<br />And you’re better than the drugs<br />I used to love<br /><br />I would lose my decadence<br />I’d do away with all the dirtiness<br />For your love<br />I would become innocent<br />I’d listen to everything mamma said<br />For your love<br /><br />Cause you’re hotter than the sun<br />And you’re better than the drugs<br />I used to love<br />And you’re deadly like a gun<br />Yeah you’re deadly like the drugs<br />Oh the drugs, I used to love<br /><br />Send me down an angel<br />And let it pull me up from my own hell<br />We could float around this place<br />We’d be above all of the pain in ecstasy<br /><br />Cause you’re hotter than the sun<br />And you’re better than the drugs<br />I used to love<br />And you’re deadly like a gun<br />Yeah you’re deadly like the drugs<br />Oh the drugs, I used to love<br /><br />Give my best to the mess<br />I’ve had my fill of it<br />And give my worst to the curse<br />I’ve had my fill of it<br />And give my blessing to depression<br />I’ve had enough of it<br />Had e- had e-<br />Had enough of it<br /><br />Cause you’re hotter than the sun<br />And you’re better than the drugs<br />I used to love<br />And you’re deadly like a gun<br />Yeah you’re deadly like the drugs<br />Oh the drugs, oh the drugs<br />I used to love
