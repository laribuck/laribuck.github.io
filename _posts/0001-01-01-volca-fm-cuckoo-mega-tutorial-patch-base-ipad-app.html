It's a wonderful sounding little FM synthesiser, with a quick sequencer, and full in depth FM editing capabilities.<br /><br />Here's a lengthy tutorial where I'm taking you through the sounds, the sequencer, quick editing, in depth editing, playing it with an external MIDI keyboard, and also editing with a compatible iPad software called Patch Base.<br /><br />Since FM synthesis by nature is somewhat technical, please be patient and take your time to understand it. Once you grasp the concept, I don't think it's &quot;difficult&quot;, but it requires you to keep a lot of information in your head at once. And even though youre getting good with it, it still requires time and precision.<br /><br />I think it sounds absolutely wonderful. And anything that sounds wonderful is, in my opinion, worth learning.<br /><br />Cheers<br />CUCKOO<br /><br /><br />Volca FM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/volca_fm/">http://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/volca_fm/</a><br />Patch Base iPad app: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://coffeeshopped.com/patch-base">https://coffeeshopped.com/patch-base</a><br />QuNexus keyboard: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.keithmcmillen.com/products/qunexus/">https://www.keithmcmillen.com/products/qunexus/</a>
