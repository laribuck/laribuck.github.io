Pop goes the Question with a twist.        Between December 1989 'Laura's first date' and July 1998 'Pop goes the question'   Steve and Laura experienced some of the best and Worst days of their lives together. But many just average. Between two completely different personalities, over time, a bond was formed.  For a long time, neither was able to own it, or define it. (though  I think they both begin to sense it early on, even as early as season 3). I know there were (are) a number of 'Laura haters' out there and though she at times was shamefully unbearable and cruel (haven't we all been at some point?) the plot/story does take the correct path with them.  Laura stated that she <br />couldn't imagine her life without Steve .. I think the studio dropped the ball here.<br />With no wedding coming to air they could have presented something more on what all those years meant.  It was somewhat of a let down.  (not a knock, or criticism)<br /><br />So...here....  it's certainly not even close to everything.<br />  <br />Just a thought..  How could it have been any other way.<br /><br />Thank you Family matters<br /><br />enjoy
