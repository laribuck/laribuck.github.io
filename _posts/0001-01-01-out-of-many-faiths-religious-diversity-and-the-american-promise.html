America is the most religiously devout country in the Western world and the most religiously diverse nation on the planet. In today’s volatile climate of religious conflict, prejudice, and distrust, how do we affirm the principle that the American promise is deeply intertwined with how each of us engages with people of different faiths and beliefs?<br /><br />Join us for a discussion on the state of interfaith dialogue and the challenges and opportunities in today’s polarized climate for religious pluralism. Our conversation will highlight key observations from Eboo Patel’s new book, Out of Many Faiths, and feature author Eboo Patel, series co-editor Earl Lewis, and Council for Christian Colleges &amp; Universities President Shirley Hoogstra.
