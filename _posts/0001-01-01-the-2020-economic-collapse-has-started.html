A lot is changing on 1 August in the UK and I thought it is important to highlight how many of these changes are going to be impacting the economy and the outlook for jobs.<br /><br />Not many people seem to be talking about the economic prospects of so many different factors coming together - the end of mortgage, credit card and loan payment holidays, the massive rise in unemployment and the end of the UK furlough scheme which is going to force businesses to make some very tough decisions.<br /><br />UK banks have lost over 10% in share price over the last week as they have begun setting aside money for the loans they do not expect to collect and as the impact of the economic downturn becomes apparent.<br /><br />In this short video I bring all of these topics together to present a very important point of view that I am not seeing widely discussed.<br /><br />CAMERA GEAR I USE<br />○ My camera - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/sasha-camera">https://bit.ly/sasha-camera</a><br />○ Main lens - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/sasha-lens">https://bit.ly/sasha-lens</a><br />○ Microphone - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/sasha-mic">https://bit.ly/sasha-mic</a><br />○ Tripod - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/sasha-tripod">https://bit.ly/sasha-tripod</a><br />○ Memory card - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/sasha-card">https://bit.ly/sasha-card</a><br />○ Ring light - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/sasha-light">https://bit.ly/sasha-light</a><br />Full list of gear here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kit.co/sashayanshin/sasha-video-gear">https://kit.co/sashayanshin/sasha-video-gear</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Some of these links may be affiliate links.
