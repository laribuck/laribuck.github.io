A few clips of Noam Chomsky discussing some of the philosophical implications of his work in linguistics and the nature of language in regards to creativity, freedom, and the limits of human knowledge and cognition. This is from a 1978 interview with Bryan Magee. Such high quality clips come from the channel &quot;Manufacturing Intellect&quot;.<br /><br />Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PhilosophyOverdoseYoutube">https://www.facebook.com/PhilosophyOverdoseYoutube</a>
