There are millions of reasons why we shouldn't accept ourselves and continually find flaws in our past and be pessimistic about our future. Self-acceptance isn't something that can be fixed by self-care or by something else telling you that you are worthy. You need to love yourself first. Learning how to accept yourself starts with being okay with what happened in your past and having a plan and confidence to face problems in the present. <br />We must be self aware of what we are holding onto from the past and take steps towards an approach of letting go and knowing that we have the ability to change. We have the choice to either accept or disapprove. Here are the 5 steps to self-acceptance that I speak about in this video. I go in depth with examples and I encourage you to watch and take notes of what you will do to be open and accept yourself for who you are at this moment. <br />Step 1: You did the best you could, or what you thought was right at the time<br />Step 2: Perfection is not the goal in life<br />Step 3: Fix easy problems now and make a plan for harder ones<br />Step 4: Your past has good in it. Day dream about your successes<br />Step 5: Write down what is unique about you<br /><br />Life is an adventure and self acceptance isn't an easy thing to do. This is a long road so take all the time you need. <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2k1XpGt">https://bit.ly/2k1XpGt</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/depressiontoexpression">http://www.instagram.com/depressiontoexpression</a><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/depressiontoexpression">http://www.facebook.com/depressiontoexpression</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/expressionscott">http://www.twitter.com/expressionscott</a><br />HELP ME: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/depressiontoexpression">http://www.patreon.com/depressiontoexpression</a><br />WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.depressiontoexpression.com">http://www.depressiontoexpression.com</a><br />QUESTIONS? scott@depressiontoexpression.com<br /><br />Our Mission: Create an honest dialogue about mental health by educating and inspiring people to express themselves freely with confidence<br /><br />Thank you to everyone who supports this channel and the mission of Depression to Expression.
