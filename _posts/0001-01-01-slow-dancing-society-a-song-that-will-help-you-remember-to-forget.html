With support by Drew Sullivan himself, this is &quot;A Song That Will Help You Remember To Forget&quot; by Slow Dancing Society.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/slowdancingsociety">http://www.myspace.com/slowdancingsociety</a><br /><br />It was hard to choose just one song off his debut album &quot;The Sound of Lights When Dim&quot;, so I urge you to listen to the whole record instead when you have the chance.<br /><br />If you want to show SDS your support and don't mind sparing a few bucks while you're at it, you can buy his albums here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://agora.hiddenshoal.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=13">http://agora.hiddenshoal.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=13</a><br /><br />Enjoy! :)
