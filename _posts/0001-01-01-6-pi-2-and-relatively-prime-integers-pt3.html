Designed for anyone who has a passion for mathematics, this derivation of a classical result in math is suitable for advanced middle schoolers through undergraduate math. Further, teachers may want to show this to Math Clubs/Teams. Thius 3-part video builds on results from previous videos, is related to a post on MathNotations and is dedicated to the &quot;Greatest Teacher in America&quot; -- Prof. Jaime Escalante who passed away a few days ago.
