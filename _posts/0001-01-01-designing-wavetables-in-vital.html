This stream will focus on wavetable design and Vital's wavetable editor. Vital makes it incredibly simple to design and build your own tables from scratch.<br /><br />These tables, along with other content for Vital, will be available on my gumroad upon Vital's release. @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gumroad.com/databroth">https://gumroad.com/databroth</a><br />in the mean time you can pick up a few freebies there as well
