As we make our way back to camp, we find another caravan. We'll raid it free of charge! Now that's service!<br /><br />The 'Blazing Deserts' DLC for Battle Brothers expands the game with new lands of burning deserts and lush oases to the south. Visit independent city states, fight in the arena, face desert raiders and southern beasts in battle. Wear new gear inspired by Arabian and Persian cultures of the medieval ages, employ alchemical contraptions and primitive firearms, and forge your own path when the fires of religious turmoil threaten to engulf the world in a new late game crisis!<br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLWCUXtEhm1BhB-GYcEZCbg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLWCUXtEhm1BhB-GYcEZCbg/join</a>
