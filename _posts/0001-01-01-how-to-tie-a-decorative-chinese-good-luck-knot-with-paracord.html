The knot is two four part crown knots overlying each other with the second crowning running in the opposite direction to the first. A similar knot which some call the Japanese good luck knot can also be tied with the crown knots running in the same direction giving the knot a slightly different appearance. The Chinese often attached meaning to their different knots they crafted. This one universally seems to have a meaning of good luck as sailors also often tied it for a good luck charm.<br /><br />Use: <br />This knot could be used as a pendant for a knot necklace, stitched onto a pillow for decoration.
