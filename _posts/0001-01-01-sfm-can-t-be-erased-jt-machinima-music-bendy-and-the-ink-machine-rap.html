It's there for a reason.<br />- Videos where you add subtitles for the lyrics, in english or any other. Youtube has a feature that allows you to submit subtitles onto people's videos and it is enabled on every one of my videos which I manage often. If you want to translate my video, then submit it through that and I'll approve it as soon as I can.<br />- Straight re-uploads to the original without anything changed.
