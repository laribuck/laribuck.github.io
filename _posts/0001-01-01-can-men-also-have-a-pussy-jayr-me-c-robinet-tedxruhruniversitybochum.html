Can men also have a pussy? | Jayrome C. Robinet | TEDx Ruhr University Bochum<br /><br />#tedxrub2019 #embracetheunexpected #transgender<br /><br />Jayrôme C. Robinet, writer, translator, spoken word performer and writing coach based in Berlin, used to live as a white French woman. When he moved to Berlin, started testosterone and grew a dark beard, he experienced changes not only regarding his identity but in the behavior of people towards him.<br /><br />In his talk he compares how he was treated as a man in contrast to how he was treated as a woman, and he explores what it means, if not only one’s gender changes but apparently also one’s ethnicity and age. Robinet´s goal is to contribute to a better understanding of social role models and assumptions in order to build a world where all identities have the liberty to develop themselves fully.<br />________<br /><br />TEDx RuhrUniversityBochum was started in 2016 by a group of students enthusiastic about bringing the TEDx format to the Ruhr Area. In May 2019, we turned our TEDx conference into one of the largest TEDx events in Europe organized by students. We connected over 1,000 people at our TEDx event and brought 13 speakers to Bochum who presented their ideas and visions regarding the motto &quot;Embrace the Unexpected&quot;. <br /><br />„Embrace the unexpected“ is not just a theme, it is an attitude.<br />It is to look courageously and curiously towards the future and confidently embrace the manifold challenges of our time. To understand the new and unexpected as a learning opportunity for progress and not as a source of uncertainty. Such an attitude is needed in a rapidly changing world, now more than ever.<br /><br />Find out more about TEDx RuhrUniversityBochum on our website: www.tedxruhruniversitybochum.de <br />Instagram: @tedxruhruniversitybochum<br /><br />#tedxruhruniversitybochum #ruhruniversitätbochum #tedxtalks #tedkonferenzdeutschland #globalissues2019 #genderidentity #socialrolemodel #transempowerment<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
