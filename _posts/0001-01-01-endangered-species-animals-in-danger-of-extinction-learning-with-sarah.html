It's crazy to think that some animals might not exist in a couple of year's time... that's why we need to put a stop to it! 😿🐻🐅🐘<br />🤯Imagine telling your future children, that Polar bears are like dinosaurs, they no longer exist <br />💭What are you going to do to make a difference? <br />👇 Let us know in the comments below <br /><br />👉SUBSCRIBE TO HAPPY LEARNING! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/HappyLearningTV">http://bit.ly/HappyLearningTV</a><br />👉Web site: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://happylearning.tv/en/">https://happylearning.tv/en/</a><br />👉Follow us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/HappyLearningTv">https://www.facebook.com/HappyLearningTv</a><br /><br />Recommended video: DINOSAURS: The mysterious extinction<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/wclG0qIaXYo">https://youtu.be/wclG0qIaXYo</a><br />---------<br />Hello Happy Friends? <br />Are you ready to learn?<br />I’m Sarah, and today, we’re going to talk about animals, but specifically, those that are in danger of being extinct, those that are about to vanish forever! <br />Look, this is… my…  <br />He’s very lucky, because he lives in my house, and we take very good care of him.<br />But there are a lot of animals, that aren’t this lucky. <br />Can you imagine all dogs on Earth disappear? <br />Well there are some animals that are about to disappear completely, like the tigers, lynxes, whales, polar bears, tortoises, even bees are close to being extinct! <br />Actually, in some places they have already disappeared, and that makes me sad, very sad…<br />But… What can we do to help the animals?<br />The first thing is learning lots of things about them! :<br />Where they live… what they eat… and how they are affected by what humans do.<br />The more we know about animals, the more we will love them, because they are so great!<br />They are so beautiful! Also! Some of them are so cool and fun! <br />We also need to walk in the woods, so we can get to know nature, enjoy it and take care of it like nature deserves. <br />If we threw this small plastic bag into the ocean, it could mean the death of some sea creature, like a dolphin or a sea turtle. <br />Look at these images.<br />This seal has eaten plastic thinking it was food. Sadly the poor thing  will probably die.<br />Do you realise how important it is to respect and take care of nature?<br />Another way of taking care of nature and saving animals, is consuming in an ecological manner. <br />Switching off lights when we don’t need them, closing taps, turning the tv off when we aren’t watching.<br />If we do all these things, nature will be a looot cleaner, and animals will live longer, and better lives! And they will never ever ever become extinct. <br />We all fit in this world, the Earth is our home, and home to all living things! <br />Will you help us take care of it? I hope you do! <br />Goodbye Happy friends! <br />I hope you’re always ready to learn! <br />Goodbye!
