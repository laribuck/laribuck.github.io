Meeting you with a view to a kill <br /><br />Face to face in secret places feel the chill <br /><br />Nightfall covers me <br /><br />But you know, the plans I'm making <br /><br />Still oversee <br /><br />Could it be the whole earth opening wide <br /><br />A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside <br /><br />The weekends why, until we <br /><br /><br /><br />Dance into the fire <br /><br />That fatal kiss is all we need <br /><br />Dance into the fire <br /><br />To fatal sounds of broken dreams <br /><br />Dance into the fire <br /><br />That fatal kiss is all we need <br /><br />Dance into the fire <br /><br /><br /><br />The choice for you is the view to a kill <br /><br />Between the shades assassination standing still <br /><br />The first crystal tears <br /><br />Fall as snowflakes on your body <br /><br />First time in years <br /><br />To drench your skin with lover's rosy stain <br /><br />A chance to find a phoenix for the flame <br /><br />A chance to die, but can we <br /><br /><br /><br />Dance into the fire <br /><br />That fatal kiss is all we need <br /><br />Dance into the fire <br /><br />To fatal sounds of broken dreams <br /><br />Dance into the fire <br /><br />That fatal kiss is all we need <br /><br />Dance into the fire
