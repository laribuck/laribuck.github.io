I started this YouTube channel as a hobby to keep to help players advance, providing in depth analysis on new champs, keep players abreast of updates to the game and hopefully bring in fun times along the way.<br /> <br />I hope you enjoy the content on the channel, and I am very happy to hear advice, feedback, news or questions from anyone.<br /> <br />I appreciate your love and support.<br /> <br />KT1<br /> <br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Most popular questions I get:<br /> <br />1. Who is your favourite champion: Quake.<br />2. Best champion in the game? She can shut down most content, save for evade removers that activate immediately; I will be right in the corner and let’s see you shake.<br />3. Second best champ in the game? Ghost; in general, what quake can’t shake, she can phase, just watch out for armour breaks and you’ll be good.<br />4. Third best? Hmm depends on the situation, but if it can’t be quaked or ghosted then in general you might need a specific counter, so it varies
