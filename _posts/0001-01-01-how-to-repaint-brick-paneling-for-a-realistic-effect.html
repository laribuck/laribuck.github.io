I teach set construction at a college and we use a lot of brick paneling. I like the paneling but students often times want the bricks to be a different color or look more realistic.  We used to paint each brick by hand and that took forever... then I came up with an easier method.  It allows you to choose the mortar color and the brick colors.   The key to a great look is using saturated colors and rolling on a 45 degree angle with light pressure so the paint doesn't press into the mortar.  The panels have raised brick on them so if you press lightly you will only paint the tops of the bricks.  Also be certain there is only a thin even coat of paint on the roller.  If you do accidentally paint the mortar, simply use a small brush to touch it up later.  For a real finished look apply caulk to the seams and nail holes before painting.
