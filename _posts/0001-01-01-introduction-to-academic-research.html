It is intended for undergraduates or students returning to a university student role after a long hiatus.<br />It defines certain relevant  terminology (scholarly / peer-reviewed) and discusses the limitations of specific information sources. It explains some characteristics that qualify an information source as &quot;scholarly,&quot; and provides examples. It also points out some of the Library's online access points (starting places) for searching out scholarly sources.
