Iâ€™ve been studying abroad in Germany for 100 days now! My experiences here have been so amazing, and I wanted to make this video for people interested in the differences in German culture compared to the US. I hope the tone does not come across as complaining, because I truly love German culture and all of its unique aspects. My camera kept dying, so I apologize for the video cuts! <br /><br />Please consider studying abroad with CBYX!<br />My Camera - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2T3FcKe">https://amzn.to/2T3FcKe</a> <br />Tripod - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LosGRp">https://amzn.to/2LosGRp</a>
