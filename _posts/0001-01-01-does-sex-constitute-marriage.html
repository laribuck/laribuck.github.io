For years we were taught that if a man or woman had sexual intercourse with the opposite sex, he or she was automatically 'married' to that person. However, is this what the bible says, is this actually written in it? Well, after taking a closer look at the scriptures we've discovered that this is completely false and cannot be found anywhere in the bible! The truth is Having Sex Does Not Constitute Marriage. If a person can jump from bed to bed and he/she is supposedly married to those who they had sex with: then the words fornication, adultery, and whoremonger carry absolutely no weight at all. Their meanings are morally irrelevant. Eliminating these words leaves nothing to keep mankind on the path of obedience to God. So, what is revealed in this lesson is the absolute bible truth: In no way does having Sex with a woman or man constitute marriage.
