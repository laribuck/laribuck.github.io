Bend your legs at the knees, and press your lower back down to the bench. Raise your straight arms up in the air, and start to move them slowly behind your head. Do not bend your arms at the elbows.<br />- Sit on a chair with your side facing a mirror. Bring your arms to the sides, and bend them at the elbows so that they create a 90ยบ angle. Without changing the angle, move your palms as far back as they can go. After that, reposition your arms so that the tips of your fingers are directed at the floor. Try to move your palms back as far as you can.<br />- Stand on your knees, and put your arms in front of you so that both of your elbows and palms are on the floor. Try to spread your knees as far as you can. Your shins should be at a 90ยบ angle to your thighs.<br />- Standing hamstring stretch will help you stretch your calves, hamstrings, glutes, neck, and back.<br />- If you need to make your shoulders, back, triceps, and neck more flexible, try triceps stretch. An effective exercise that will stretch your glutes, hips, thighs, and back is the butterfly stretch.<br />- The lunging hip flexor stretch will help you stretch your glutes, hips, and quads. Sphinx Pose allows you to gently stretch your lower back. On top of that, when you do this exercise, you make your abs work.<br />- If your muscles have to strain to keep you balanced while you're opening that hamstring, you won't get good results.<br />- This is why it's better to go with a comfortable position. Make sure you can spend enough time in this position. Only after that should you start to stretch your body.<br />- When doing your stretching exercises, concentrate on your breathing rather than your muscles. This is a great way to get rid of tension.<br />- Try to move more rather than being static. When you get into a position, don't try to go deeper and deeper into the bend. Instead, relax, and start moving.<br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br /><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Photos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br />East News<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>
