Restoration of a VERY RARE LIGHTER from world war II. This is a Normandy beach area metal detector ground found, with a special emblem attached to it. See me restore this war relic.<br /><br />ABOUT THE RARE LIGHTER<br />This is a EXTREMELY rare and special war relic probably from the World war 2. The lighter was very worn out before the restoration. According to the  donator it was found near the coast of the Utah beach in Normandy France with metal detector equipment. This is one of the beaches where the allies landed the coast at D-day June 6. 1944 ‚Äì So my guess is that it has been in the ground since the days around D-day 1944.<br /><br />THE RESTORATION PROCESS<br />I started by cleaning the emblem who was attached to the lighter. I was VERY surprised when I saw how cool this emblem looked. I guess it is an old US marine emblem from world war 1 or 2 but I am not sure. I heated the lighter to remove all the parts which were soldered to the lighter and there after I removed all tiny parts. They were very hard to remove. I guess the many years on Normandy beach in France has been harsh to it.<br /><br />I sandblasted the brass body and grinded the whole lighter with 500, 1000 and 1500 grit. I polished it to mirror blank and added all the small part again.<br /><br />The beautiful US marine emblem was cleaned in vinegar before it was attached to the lighter again. This is such a beautiful war relic and I hope that you enjoy this restoration video. <br /><br />Please subscribe if you want to see more cool upcoming projects üôÇ And DON‚ÄôT FORGET TO SEE my Vietnam War Zippo Lighter Restoration - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/tXCW8OaWm4A">https://youtu.be/tXCW8OaWm4A</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching my channel.
