I need to make a decision. Which way do I go? At times, we just do not know what to do. We are lost, we see no way forward. This is not about despondency, just being confused about the future, confused about life. Nothing is clear in those moments, we are confused and it feels like nothing makes a difference. Everything looks the same. Everything feels the same. <br /><br />When this happens, say yes to all open doors and wait for God to close those doors that do not lead to Him. Be proactive and have a positive attitude. Trust that God loves you and that God will never abandon you. He will keep calling you, until all other voices are lost and His voice is the only one you can still hear.<br /><br />Support this Channel and our Monastery: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mullmonastery.com/donate/">https://mullmonastery.com/donate/</a><br />Purchase our prayer ropes (Black Hebridean sheep wool &amp; natural shells): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.mullmonastery.com/product-category/prayer-ropes/">https://shop.mullmonastery.com/product-category/prayer-ropes/</a><br /><br />Remember to Share and Subscribe!
