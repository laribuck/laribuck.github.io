I also implemented my personal experiences and the pros and cons of each location to find the worst and best places to live. <br />My biggest suggestion is to visit these cities and states first to decide where you want to move to.<br /><br />➽ SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos EVERY WEEK!<br /><br />Thanks for watching From Here to There!
