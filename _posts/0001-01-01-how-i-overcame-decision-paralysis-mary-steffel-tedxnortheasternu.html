More often than not, we find ourselves immobilized with indecision- unable to choose between two or more alternatives, whether their impact on our lives is small or large. Mary Steffel is an assistant professor of marketing at Northeastern who specializes in decisions and decision delegation. In her talk, Mary describes the importance of delegating decisions to others and how we can overcome decision paralysis. Assistant professor of marketing at the Dâ€™Amore-McKim School of Business Dr. Mary Steffel (Ph.D. Princeton University, University of Florida) serves on the Office of Evaluation Sciences at the General Services Administration and has served on the White House Social and Behavioral Sciences Team, where she helps to translate and test evidence-based insights into concrete recommendations for how to improve government. <br /><br />Her hobbies include performing choral music and participating in half marathons. One of her favorite places to visit is New York City. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
