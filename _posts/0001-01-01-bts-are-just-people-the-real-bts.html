Hi! With BTS day by day getting more and more popular their fanbase is also growing bigger and bigger. New ARMY's (maybe also some of the old ones) tend to think of BTS as of only idols and all they can do is sing, rap and dance..  We forget that they are just ordinary people with families, friends. They also have struggles, they also feel sad, depressed and lonely. With this video I wanted to change a view people think of BTS and idols in general. Hope I succeeded.<br />---------------------<br />🎵 Intro : 2! 3! by BTS<br />----------------------<br />📣If you want to react to my videos and post them on Youtube, please give some credit to my channel :)<br />----------------------<br />🚫DO NOT REUPLOAD THIS VIDEO (or some parts of this video) ON YOUTUBE OR ANY OTHER VIDEO PLATFORM🚫<br />----------------------<br />❗I do NOT own any of these clips and songs except the editing<br />❗All credit goes to the rightful owners<br />❗No copyright infringement intended<br />----------------------<br />Hope you enjoyed, if you did, leave a like and subscribe!
