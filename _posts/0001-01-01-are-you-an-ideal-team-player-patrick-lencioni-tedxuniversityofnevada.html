Patrick Lencioni thinks it is time to change the way we prepare people for success.  Drawing from his book, The Ideal Team Player, Lencioni makes the compelling case that the key to success in an increasingly team-oriented world is being humble, hungry and smart.  Whether you’re a CEO or a 7th grader, focusing on these deceptively simple virtues can radically improve your personal and professional effectiveness and fulfillment. Assess Yourself: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tablegroup.com/books/ideal-team-player/self-assessment/">https://www.tablegroup.com/books/ideal-team-player/self-assessment/</a> <br /><br /> Patrick Lencioni is founder of The Table Group and the pioneer of the organizational health movement. Lencioni’s passion for organizations and teams is reflected in his writing, speaking and executive consulting. He is the author of 12 books, which have sold over six million copies and have been translated into more than 30 languages.  His capstone book, The Advantage, is the pre-eminent source on organizational health. After eighteen years in print, his classic book, The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, remains a weekly fixture on national best-seller lists. Other notable Lencioni classics include The Ideal Team Player, The Truth About Employee Engagement, and his most recent release, The Motive: Why So Many Leaders Abdicate Their Most Important Responsibilities. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
