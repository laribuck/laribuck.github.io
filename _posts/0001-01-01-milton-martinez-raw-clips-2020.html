Milton always seems to be skating at max speed, in order to go as far or as high as he possible can. Hailing from Argentina, Milton has the ability to skate any type of terrain, no matter how sketchy or rough it might seem. He made his way to 2017 SLS pro open by placing 11th in the Tampa Pro. Although finishing 27th, Milton made his presence felt soaring as high as the palm trees on the Barcelona Beach. In 2017 Milton dropped insane parts in both “The Creature Video” and Volcom’s “Holy Stokes”, that truly tested the limits of what is possible on a skateboard. We can not wait to see Milton ripping around the SLS courses.<br />BORN: March 5, 1991 in Mar del Plata, ARG<br />STANCE: Goofy<br />SPONSORS: Red Bull, Converse, Indy, Creature, OJ Wheels, Bronson, Shifty Skate Shop, Volcom<br />INSTAGRAM: @miltonmartinez
