2020: Addendum: The Tirade is a bad video series and I'm currently in the process of explaining why. Until I get around to picking apart this video, check out the current videos starting from here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66SD5EHrgpg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66SD5EHrgpg</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Just take a moment to close your eyes and imagine yourself in the fantasy world constructed by Hiro Mashima. Join me together as we learn about the accidental purgatory formed from neglect and incompetence!<br /><br />BestGuyEver: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGgy9QqFwElrVg4vf6QNX_A">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGgy9QqFwElrVg4vf6QNX_A</a><br />JaxBlade: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jaxblade07">https://www.youtube.com/user/jaxblade07</a><br /><br />Text Version: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/UMwRYHCG">https://pastebin.com/UMwRYHCG</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/craftsdwarf">https://www.patreon.com/craftsdwarf</a><br />Side Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRQdzITjLWnmmY4X8BLvNGA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRQdzITjLWnmmY4X8BLvNGA</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Craftsdwarf">https://twitter.com/Craftsdwarf</a><br />MAL:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/Craftsdwarf">https://myanimelist.net/profile/Craftsdwarf</a><br /><br />Thoughts as of November 2018: Fairy Tailâ€™s magic system is nonexistant but this video is still kind of stupid. Like, I'm pretty sure I don't agree with the 'all shonen need hard work' thing and Fairy Tail does have it later on. I talk more about problems with this video in Tirade LIES (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuLH3SElZOQ).">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuLH3SElZOQ).</a>
