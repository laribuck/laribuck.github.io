I tried KETO for a week. It's a high fat, low carbohydrate diet where the macro distribution is around 70% fat, 20% protein and 10% carbs. But it's also important not to exceed 50 grams of carbohydrates, because that can be enough to get you Kicked out of the keto club. This obviously means that you also have to be diligent with counting calories and have control over the nutritional content of what you buy.<br />I used Ketostix to check if was in ketosis.<br /><br />Check out my other videos:<br /><br />I Tried Jocko Willink's 4:30 AM Morning Routine<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/uZk94HWa6lQ">https://youtu.be/uZk94HWa6lQ</a><br /><br />I Tried Tim Ferriss' Morning Routine for 7 days | My 3 Takeaways<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/mRgSFNPE98k">https://youtu.be/mRgSFNPE98k</a><br /><br />Music in this video is provided by Artlist.
