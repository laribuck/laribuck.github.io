After this video was uploaded, it was brought to my attention that I failed to credit the original authors of many of the boards and softwares that made this project possible.<br />Full credit goes to @GmanModz for developing the U-Amp (the digital audio amp), the RVL-PMS (battery and voltage regulation system), and the USB-C system that the system relies so heavily on.  Many of Gman's projects are open source and can be found on his Github: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/Gmanmodz">https://github.com/Gmanmodz</a><br />Full credit goes to Aurelio Mannara for developing BBLoader (the software on the Wii that allows for portables to be possible) and GC+ 2.0 (the replacement GameCube controller built into the system).  His Github: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/Aurelio92">https://github.com/Aurelio92</a><br /><br />The original boards for everything listed above can be found at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.bitbuilt.net/">https://store.bitbuilt.net/</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching!
