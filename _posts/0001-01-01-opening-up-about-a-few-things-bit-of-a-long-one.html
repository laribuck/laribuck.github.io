Just talking about a few things that are on my mind. Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE (with notifications) if you want to know when I go live. THANKYOU so so SO much for your continued support.<br /><br />Second Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCswfkXrGNqgHeDfNaf82wkw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCswfkXrGNqgHeDfNaf82wkw</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching, my name's Phil and I'm a former gambling addict. I make videos to share my experiences of gambling and talk about my recovery, abstinence and the challenges of quitting gambling. I also tend to ramble on about anything else that comes to mind and take great pleasure in dispelling some of the most common myths around gambling.<br /><br />If you found this video interesting then check out the channel and consider subscribing (it would mean a lot). If you are struggling with a gambling problem then hopefully  my videos will help but I strongly recommend getting some proper help from the guys below (I'm no expert, just someone who has 'been there, done that and got the t-shirt...(no) merch link in bio'.<br /><br />My Second Channel: (Not much to see yet but I'm sure with all this extra time we have I'll find plenty to rant about!)  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCswfkXrGNqgHeDfNaf82wkw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCswfkXrGNqgHeDfNaf82wkw</a><br /><br />National Self-Exclusion Scheme: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://self-exclusion.co.uk/">https://self-exclusion.co.uk/</a><br />GAMCARE (Support and advice for problem gamblers): www.gamcare.org.uk<br />BreakEven (Free local gambling counselling): www.breakeven.org.uk<br />The Samaritans (If you ever feel like it is too much or contemplate self-harm): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.samaritans.org/">https://www.samaritans.org/</a> or call 116 123
