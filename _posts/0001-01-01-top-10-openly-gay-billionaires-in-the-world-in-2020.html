The LGBT community has had a strong impact on history since the last century, but more marked in the previous decade. They have raised their voices to claim their rights and show the world that sexual preference has nothing to do with how successful a person can be.<br /><br />In these times, many characters with great recognition and fame have made known to the world what they really are and feel. Many of them belong to the list of the wealthiest people in the world, and some have invested part of their fortune in defending the rights of the LGBT community and charitable foundations.<br /><br />Do not be afraid; in the end, it does not matter what gender the person you love or to whom you are attracted is. What will determine your success is your desire to improve yourself and to be better every day. The stigmata are wrong, and you should never be guided by it.<br /><br />Please support us by clicking like &amp; subscribe, thank you so much!<br /><br />#LGBTQ #TOPlist #Billionaire
