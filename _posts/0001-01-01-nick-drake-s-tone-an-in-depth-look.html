THE TUNING IS ACTUALLY CGCFCE CAPO 2. Youtube doesn't let you d annotations any more, or I would have changed it in the video. Sorry!!!<br /><br />strings: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.juststrings.com/dad-nb1253.html?cmp=nextopia&amp;kw=dad-nb1253">http://www.juststrings.com/dad-nb1253.html?cmp=nextopia&amp;kw=dad-nb1253</a><br /><br />Please leave any comments or questions! There's definitely a lot of guesswork and inference involved here, but this is the best I've got. Just my little tribute to a (still) underappreciated genius. My guitar here is a Martin 000-28H. I'm recording on a Zoom H2 and have a little compression going on.
