963HZ 》FREQUENCY OF GODS 》Ask Universe What You Want 》Manifest Anything. Its all based on Law of Attraction<br /><br />You can use this as sleep music, please play at low volumes.<br /><br />Q: How to Manifest Anything and Ask Universe Whatever You Want?<br /><br />1 : Get very clear about what you want. When you are very clear about your own deepest desire, when you are in touch with that, you can take steps to manifest that.<br /><br />2 : Once you know what you want, its time to ask the universe. Meditate, Visualise, Prayer - every thing helps. <br /><br />3 : Create space and time in your life for the new positive things to manifest. Its very easy to get in the grind and hustle and becoming busy in taking steps to make something happen, but you must also create the space and time in your life to let those new experiences come in. Time to enjoy and smile at those small experiences which make our life beautiful. <br /><br />4 : Give before you can receive. This derives from step 3. You need to give away whatever is occupying your time and space to receive something new. So, whatever you are hoarding, let go. Whatever you are clinging to, let go.<br /><br />5 : Gratitude always. Always and Always thank you the universe for whatever comes into your life. Do not reject, embrace it. With open arms. Everyday is a blessing of that creator to experience something new in this life, embrace it.<br /><br />6 : Raise the vibration in and around you.  Meditate, exercise, smile, and keep the things inside and outside in your environment clean and positive. Play positive energy music in the house and office.<br /><br />7 : Miracles do happen. Trust the process. When you are ready to receive, you will be amazed how everything in this journey panned out and conspired to manifest your inner desire.<br /><br />Read More at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.meditativemind.org">http://www.meditativemind.org</a><br /><br />Copyright ⓒ 2019 Meditative Mind™.
