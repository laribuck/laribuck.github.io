Essentially Ellington 2016 Competition<br />San Diego School of Creative and Performing Arts<br />Friday, May 6, 2016<br /><br />This year, the 21st annual Essentially Ellington High School Jazz Band Competition &amp; Festival once again brought top ensembles from all over the United States to perform at the House of Swing in New York City. <br /><br />Jazz at Lincoln Center is committed to instilling a broader understanding of Duke Ellington’s music, which lies at the very heart of America’s 20th-century musical heritage and the core of the rich canon of jazz music. That’s why we  created the Essentially Ellington program (EE) during the 1995–96 school year to make Ellington’s music accessible to as many high school musicians as possible and to support the development of their schools’ music programs.<br /><br />Learn more about Essentially Ellington: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://academy.jazz.org/ee/about/">http://academy.jazz.org/ee/about/</a>
