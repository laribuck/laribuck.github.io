This is a really nice and colorful design level by JerkRat. I can understand the name of the level, since itâ€™s quite distinct from other levels these days when it comes to colors. There arenâ€™t many levels with as many color pulses or as many colors combined as this one. The song allows for that and it makes for some awesome synchronization. There are some parts that are a bit boring to me and don't quite match the intensity of the rest of the level, like at 0:25. In terms of gameplay, I canâ€™t say itâ€™s anything special, but there arenâ€™t any annoying parts and itâ€™s quite easy to learn. This will most definitely get Epic Easy Demon rating.<br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ Overall coin rating: Silver. 2/4. All the coins are hidden to a certain degree, but they require minimal extra skill. However, they do require some effort to find, and it's clear that JerkRat put some effort into making the last two.<br />- 1st coin: Bronze. This is the worst coin of them all, and that's just because it's a fairly easy alternate route. It's found at 0:17, where you have to go above instead of below. It's not much tighter than the normal path. Even though it's somewhat hidden, it still gets Bronze. The question marks in the part make it even more clear that there's a coin hidden somewhere.<br />- 2nd coin: Silver. For this one, you first need to collect a key at 0:45, which is quite easy to find since there's a teleportal right below the dash orb path. I think it would have been a bit better if it was more hidden. The coin is unlocked at 0:46, where you have to take an alternate route. This coin isn't much harder than the first, but it requires a lot more than the lazy first coin, which is why it gets Silver.<br />- 3rd coin: Silver. This is the best of all the coins, but it's still not quite Gold. The key is found at 1:30, and it's actually harder to get than it looks on video. You have to use the first blue orb as early as possible and then click again very fast before you hit the second blue pad, and then click again to use the yellow orb. This unlocks the coin above the next ship part, and you have to complete this as upside down. This coin isn't too well hidden and it's not very original. The key is obvious, but requires a bit of extra skill to get. <br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ Level info<br />ID: 40257022<br />In-game music: Gears of a King by DJtheSdotcom<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/519927">http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/519927</a><br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ Want me to play your level?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/forms/XRReOLzkfrA1CiWI3">https://goo.gl/forms/XRReOLzkfrA1CiWI3</a><br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ Thumbnail by Wugi<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsxVDEGpxddz9dm7eeWkYYg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsxVDEGpxddz9dm7eeWkYYg</a><br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ Merchandise store<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/viprin">https://teespring.com/stores/viprin</a><br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ My social links<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/vipringd">https://twitter.com/vipringd</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitch.tv/viprinz">http://www.twitch.tv/viprinz</a> (follow to get notified when I'm streaming!)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/vipringd/">https://instagram.com/vipringd/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+vipringd">https://plus.google.com/+vipringd</a>
