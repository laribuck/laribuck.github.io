I had tons of fun recording this video, it was definitely one of my favorite ones to record. Jason Becker is a legendary guitarist known his incredible speed and most of all his ridiculously clean sweep arpeggios. I have been a huge fan of his music since I was a teenager and it was way fun getting to play some material that emulates his style a bit. <br /><br />In the video the different topics discussed are scales (major, minor, the modes, symmetrical), sweep picking (different shapes and how to use them) and the use of expressive vibrato and whammy bar. <br /><br />For more information on Jason Becker please visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.jasonbeckerguitar.com">http://www.jasonbeckerguitar.com</a><br /><br />One on one lessons now available through Skype. <br /><br />For more information head over to: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.juanantoniomusic.com">http://www.juanantoniomusic.com</a><br /><br />Subscribe to my youtube channel for more lessons/ fun licks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/juan046">http://www.youtube.com/juan046</a><br /><br />Follow me on Facebook at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/JuanAntonioMusic">https://www.facebook.com/JuanAntonioMusic</a><br /><br />Follow me on Twitter at: <br />@juanantonio046<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/juanantonio046">https://twitter.com/juanantonio046</a>  <br /><br />Follow me on Instagram at: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/juanantonio046/">https://instagram.com/juanantonio046/</a>
