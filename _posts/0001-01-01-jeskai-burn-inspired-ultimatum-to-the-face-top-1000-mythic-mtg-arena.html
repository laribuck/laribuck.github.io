Consider joining the discord (links above) and posting your decks in the #decks channel for community feedback.<br /><br />Q: Why didn’t you play this certain card I would play?<br />A: Because I don’t think it is as good as every other card in the deck.<br /><br />Q: Why did you make that play at time stamp XX:XX?<br />A: I usually talk through my plays, so watch again and see if I mention it (I often do, sometimes during the turn after the play to keep the video moving).  If I don’t mention it at all, I may have missed it.  I miss plays several times a day, and so do other players.<br /><br />Q: How can I support the channel?<br />A: Watching the videos IS supporting the channel.  There are many options above if you have extra money and would like to help more.  I appreciate it, I have a lot of bills and life stuff to manage, but it is not required.  Take care of yourself first, watch the videos, then give other financial support if you really want to.<br /><br />Q: Will you play janky deck xyz?<br />A: My mission is to show people decks that they can play often, win games with, and feel successful with.  I don’t enjoy decks that strive to achieve an interaction but rarely win (aka, janky decks).  There are many successful jank players on YouTube, and you should check out their channels.  I am competitive, I like winning, and I like helping others win and feel successful.  That is why you won’t see janky combo decks on the channel very often.<br /><br />Q: Do you show all your games, or do you edit out your losses?<br />A: I don’t show all my games.  The video is usually the best moments of between one and three hours of recording.  I remove games for a number of reasons, both wins and losses.  Some games are slow, some aren’t competitive because of lands, some are the same matchup over and over.  More losses get cut out than wins because winning is more fun for me, which makes for better content for most viewers.  It can be disappointing for those who want to see me lose (yes, people watch just to see me lose, I see you!).<br /><br />Q: If you edit out some of your losses, how do I know if a deck is good and worth crafting?<br />A: If you watch the entire video, I always give my honest opinion about the deck at the end.  As always, you are welcome to draw your own conclusions.  My goal is to show off a variety of decks that can get a player with skill and conviction into Mythic, and I want them to have fun doing it.  I almost never show a video of a deck that I don’t believe in, and if I don’t like a deck after playing it, I guarantee you will know about it if you watch the whole video and listen to what I have to say.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />#cgb #mtg_arena #mtg
