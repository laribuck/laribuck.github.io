This clip is ultimately my tribute to the songwriters of this classic Aussie song. Garry Paige and Mark Punch were regular collaborators, and although this song along with Mark Punch, went to the Renee Geyer Band, and changed her career forever, it was also memorialised by the Johnny Rocco Band, of which Punch was also a member. With Kiwi vocalist Leo De Castro, an altogether different stamp is put onto this beautiful song. <br /><br /><br /><br />I only discovered this band and this version in recent years, but Renee's various versions of it, are among my all time favourite recordings. Her &quot;Ready to deal&quot; LP  which featured the original version of &quot;Heading&quot; and provided her with a Top 40 Hit, and later &quot;Moving Along&quot; featured a different tempo reworking, and Renee has released jazz and pop interpretations on the song as well as live recordings of the song, making it one of the signature tunes for her.<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;Heading in the Right Direction&quot; has been something of a life lesson for me over the years, and it was a real delight to uncover a male version of the classic hit. My thanks to Garry and Mark creating one of the great Australian tunes.<br /><br />Enjoy!
