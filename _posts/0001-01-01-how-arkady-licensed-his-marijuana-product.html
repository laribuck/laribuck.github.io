He is a Vice <br />President at Century Auto, an auto broker where he has worked for 16 <br />years. After becoming an inventRight student, he licensed his packaging invention for pre-rolled joints to a global<br /> packaging company that recently entered the marijuana industry. Because <br />it concerns pre-rolled joints, he expects it to roll out to the two other major <br />markets for pre-rolls, which are cigars and cigarettes. The big benefits of his<br />invention are that it’s child resistant and allows a smoker to store what is<br />left of their joint in the same package.<br /><br />Learn more about Arkady and his invention journey in this interview with his licensee, GPA Global: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.inc.com/stephen-key/the-marijuana-industry-is-ripe-for-inven.html">https://www.inc.com/stephen-key/the-marijuana-industry-is-ripe-for-inven.html</a><br /><br />Bringing an invention to market?
