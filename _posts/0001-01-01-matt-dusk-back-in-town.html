Lyrics:<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;It seems just like yesterday when we were standing here<br /><br />Yankee's hat upon my head and your voice in my ear<br /><br />I've talked about the future and all the things we'd do<br /><br />I never thought your lovin' words would frighten me from you.<br /><br /><br /><br />I remember when I sold my car to board that train<br /><br />You said you were sure that I would not come back again<br /><br />And now you see with your own eyes and start to realize<br /><br />I'm not the man I thought I was, so try to sympathize.<br /><br /><br /><br />The way you think about your life<br /><br />Is gonna change, change tonight<br /><br />Don't even try out that frown<br /><br />'cuz your man is back in town.<br /><br /><br /><br />I'm sure you've been thinkin' 'bout just where the hell I've been<br /><br />Painted your own pictures of the trouble I got in<br /><br />There were times I will admit my heart saw better days<br /><br />But I'm the type that has to lose to find I had it made.<br /><br /><br /><br />No use talkin' too much about things we cannot change<br /><br />I know you think it's crazy but I'm here to set things straight<br /><br />I'm standing here to say that I'll give love a try<br /><br />It's my complicated way to say I'll simplify.<br /><br /><br /><br />The way you think about your life<br /><br />Is gonna change, change tonight<br /><br />Don't even try out that frown<br /><br />'cuz your man is back in town<br /><br />Baby it's cool to take your time<br /><br />I was a fool, out of my mind<br /><br />So let's jump off of this merry-go-round<br /><br />'cuz your man in back in town.<br /><br /><br /><br />I was drawn away, now I'm back to stay<br /><br />I was wrong to think, there was a better way<br /><br />Now I see with my own eyes, 'bout time I realize<br /><br />I hope in time you will forgive, I'll never leave your side.<br /><br /><br /><br />The way you think about your life<br /><br />Is gonna change, change tonight<br /><br />Don't even try out that frown<br /><br />'cuz you man is back in town<br /><br />Baby it's cool to take your time<br /><br />I was a fool, out of my mind<br /><br />So let's jump off of this merry-go-round<br /><br />'cuz your man in back in town<br /><br />So let's jump off of this merry-go-round<br /><br />'cuz your man in back in town.&quot;
