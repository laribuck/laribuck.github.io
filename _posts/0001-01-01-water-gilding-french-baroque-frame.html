A newly production of a French baroque frame made by Stockholms Förgyllning &amp; Bildhuggeri <br /><br />( www.stockholmsforgyllning.com ). It has earlyer been engraved and is here being gilded, using the technique of water gilding, a old and traditional way of gilding. After applying the gold it is then carefully polished to reach its full potential - shining gold. Then this frame is to undergo a final phase to recieve a nice patina, but that is another story....
