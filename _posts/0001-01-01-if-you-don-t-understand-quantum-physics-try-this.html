A simple and clear explanation of all the important features of quantum physics that you need to know. Check out this video's sponsor <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://brilliant.org/dos">https://brilliant.org/dos</a> <br />I have spent a lot of time thinking about how best to explain quantum physics and this is the result of all my hours of pondering, and I’m really happy with how it turned out. I decided to just explain it as it actually is, rather than rely on analogies. The video explains the quantum wavefunction, particle-wave duality, the measurement problem, the double-slit experiment, superposition, entanglement, quantum tunnelling, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and energy quantisation. Let me know if it was helpful!
