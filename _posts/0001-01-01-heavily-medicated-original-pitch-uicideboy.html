How you gonna come up next?<br />But I could give a fuck about a check<br />I'd rather go and cut my neck<br />Put a bullet up in my vest, put a knife up in my chest<br />And do some drugs, let people gossip<br />Under my tongue, yeah, that's suboxone<br />Oxycontin, bitch, I'm toxic<br />Dirty cracker, bitch, I'm rotten<br />Top to bottom, $uicide, G, to da 5, to da 9<br />Yung Christ, $lick $loth<br />Rising out that slime, killers with minds, lo-fi Columbine<br />Kill them all with time, kill them all with time<br />Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br /><br />[Verse 2: JAMES $PLEEN]<br />Too fire to hit the blunt, might pack it up and head out the front<br />Sayonara sucker<br />This ain't a gun to my headâ€”it's a brain hugger<br />Painting the ceiling with little pieces<br />Killing myself, I don't really need a reason<br />Death is the reason that I'm breathing<br />Yeah, I'm beating my heart, but my heart doesn't stop beating<br />Guess I'm the dead motherfucker<br />Call me James $pleen, I'm that dead motherfucker<br />Dead pimp, pimping dead ass hoes<br />Tangled clothes, rotten ass bodies at my show<br />Close the door and throw me in the hole, here come the crows<br />Overdose on overly overcast skies, this is my goodbye side<br />$uicide ridin' with the tubes tied<br />You might think I'm shy<br />But I just really don't wanna fucking meet you, kill yourself
