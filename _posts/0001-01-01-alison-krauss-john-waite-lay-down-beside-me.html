I've spent my life looking for you<br />Finding my way wasn't easy to do<br />but I knew there was you all the while<br />And it's been worth every mile<br /><br />CHORUS:<br />So lay down beside me<br />Love me and hide me<br />Kiss all the hurtin' of this world away<br />Hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat<br />And don't ever wander away<br /><br />Mornings and evenings all were the same<br />And there was no music till I heard your name<br />But I knew when I saw you smile<br />Now I can rest for awhile
