I noticed a few amber trichomes while checking my Caramelino plant with  my new microscope. The amber trichomes and the fading leaves are signs that it's almost time to harvest this plant. And the others won't be too much longer after that. <br /><br />Here are links if you want to check out the microscope on Amazon:<br />USA ~ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2V4Axb7">https://amzn.to/2V4Axb7</a><br />CAN ~ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3dYXUeQ">https://amzn.to/3dYXUeQ</a><br />These are affiliate links, which means that I may receive a commission if you make a purchase after clicking on them.
