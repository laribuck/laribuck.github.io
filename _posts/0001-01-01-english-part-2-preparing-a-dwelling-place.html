Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me? says the Lord. Or where will my resting place be?&quot; (Acts 7:49 NIV)<br /><br />We feel the Spirit of God is calling us as individuals, nations, and as a global family into a marked time of consecration. The Holy Spirit is moving upon our hearts to remember all that Jesus has done for us, transforming us into the living stones that God is using to build His dwelling place on earth. We would like to release a call to our global family to set aside time to seek the Lord's face, posture our hearts in worship, and allow Him to speak afresh.<br /><br />The year 2020 has ushered us all into a new era. We are transitioning into the era of the Kingdom. There is an invitation to partner with God in manifesting His Kingdom here on earth. We feel that we are no longer living in Kairos moments, but are in fact in a Kairos season. Therefore, we want to take the time to let the Lord speak and establish His plans and ways in our hearts.<br /><br />We feel the Holy Spirit is bringing a holy alignment between the heart of God and His Bride. As we consecrate ourselves corporately, He will mobilize us as ONE army in holy array and prepare us for the days to come.<br /><br />We want to welcome you to join us for 28 days of prayer and fasting; setting aside time to consecrate ourselves before the Lord. During these 28 days, we will have the &quot;Preparing a Dwelling Place&quot; Gathering series that will be comprised of 4 sessions (September 17, September 24, October 1, October 8). These sessions will be broadcasted on our Facebook page as well as on our YouTube channel. Live interpretation will be available in multiple languages.<br /><br />-----<br />Welcome (00:25:11 - 00:37:00)<br />00:25:11 - Trumpet Call leading into Resting Place Video <br />00:29:21 - David Demian Welcome<br />00:34:02 - Asher Intrater Welcome &amp; Prayer<br /><br />One Family (00:37:00 - 1:12:08)<br />37:00 - David Demian - Sharing about the heart of translating into all the different languages.<br />40:34 - Ioanna Sillavan - Prioritizing the inclusion of the whole family God<br />47:29 - Ian Wong - The nature of a spiritual family.
