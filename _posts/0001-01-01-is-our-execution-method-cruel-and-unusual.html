With an estimated annual revenue of $9.5 billion dollars, it's hard to believe the NFL is legally exempt from paying government taxes. How can an organization with these kinds of numbers fairly qualify as a nonprofit? TestTube takes a look at how how they're managing to get away with this.<br /><br />Learn More:<br />Renewed Spotlight on Why the National Football League Is a Nonprofit Group<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/renewed-spotlight-nfl-nonprofit-tax-status/story?id=25535798">http://abcnews.go.com/Business/renewed-spotlight-nfl-nonprofit-tax-status/story?id=25535798</a><br />&quot;Attention over the National Football League's domestic abuse policy and the league's leadership has drawn renewed scrutiny of a fact that may surprise many people: the NFL is a nonprofit group.&quot;<br /><br />The Real Super Bowl Question: Should The NFL Be A Nonprofit?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomwatson/2014/01/30/the-real-super-bowl-question-should-the-nfl-be-a-nonprofit/">http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomwatson/2014/01/30/the-real-super-bowl-question-should-the-nfl-be-a-nonprofit/</a><br />&quot;The National Football League takes in more than $9.5 billion per year and is exempt from Federal taxes. As a nonprofit, it earns more than the Y, the Red Cross, Goodwill, the Salvation Army or Catholic Charities - yet it stands as one of the greatest profit-generating commercial advertising, entertainment and media enterprises ever created.&quot;<br /><br />Why Congress will never take back the NFL's tax break<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/15/why-congress-will-never-take-back-the-nfls-huge-tax-break/">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/15/why-congress-will-never-take-back-the-nfls-huge-tax-break/</a><br />&quot;Perhaps the most famous tax break in America is the one bestowed by Congress on the NFL. It's famous for its seeming illogic - the NFL, hugely profitable, being called a &quot;nonprofit.&quot;&quot;<br /><br />Tax-exempt? The NFL's nonprofit status by the numbers<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101996109#.">http://www.cnbc.com/id/101996109#.</a><br />&quot;The National Football League is embroiled in drama over the Ray Rice domestic violence scandal, with some voices calling for Commissioner Roger Goodell to be fired. The controversy overall has stirred curiosity about how the NFL is run, and how it makes money.&quot;<br /><br />Should the NFL Lose Its Tax-Exempt Status?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/12/nfl-tax-exempt-status-rootstrikers-roger-goodell">http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/12/nfl-tax-exempt-status-rootstrikers-roger-goodell</a><br />&quot;Times are good for the National Football League. Viewership is up. For the 47th year in a row, Harris Interactive named pro football the most popular sport in America. And with overall revenues north of $9 billion, the NFL is the most lucrative sports league on the planet.&quot;<br /><br />Examining NFL's tax-exempt status<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9342479/examining-nfl-tax-exempt-status-challenged-us-senator-tom-coburn">http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9342479/examining-nfl-tax-exempt-status-challenged-us-senator-tom-coburn</a><br />&quot;Sen. Tom Coburn has proposed an amendment to the Marketplace Fairness Act that would end the NFL's exemption from taxation. That's right -- the $10 billion-a-year NFL is a tax-exempt organization, as is the NHL and the PGA Tour.&quot;<br /><br />The NFL Is Not a Nonprofit<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2014/09/the_nfl_should_lose_its_tax_exempt_status_the_league_is_not_a_nonprofit.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2014/09/the_nfl_should_lose_its_tax_exempt_status_the_league_is_not_a_nonprofit.html</a><br />&quot;The National Football League generates about $9.5 billion in revenue each year. It is, by Forbes' estimate, the most valuable sports league in the world. Its commissioner, Roger Goodell, makes $44 million in a year. And yet, the NFL's head office has long been allowed to operate as a tax-exempt nonprofit-as if its sole purpose for existence wasn't to extract wads of cash from the wallets of American sports fans.&quot;<br /><br />The NY Times Revisits NFL Nonprofitness as Football Season Begins<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nonprofitquarterly.org/policysocial-context/24781-the-ny-times-revisits-nfl-nonprofitness-as-football-season-begins.html">https://nonprofitquarterly.org/policysocial-context/24781-the-ny-times-revisits-nfl-nonprofitness-as-football-season-begins.html</a><br />&quot;As our readers know by now, the NFL is a nonprofit organization under section 501(c)(6) of the revenue codes. This is the classification set aside for trade associations-groups that are in business to promote and create a positive business environment for their particular trade. And there are a lot of them.&quot;<br /><br />Watch More:<br />DNews: Just how common is domestic violence?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNbG3FIGk_w&amp;list=UUzWQYUVCpZqtN93H8RR44Qw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNbG3FIGk_w&amp;list=UUzWQYUVCpZqtN93H8RR44Qw</a><br /><br />Subscribe Now!<br />» Subscribe to NowThis World: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://go.nowth.is/World_Subscribe">http://go.nowth.is/World_Subscribe</a><br />_________________________<br /><br />NowThis World is dedicated to bringing you topical explainers about the world around you.
