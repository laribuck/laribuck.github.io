&quot;Expecting to Fly&quot; was written and performed solo by Neil Young while still a member of  Buffalo Springfield. Recorded on May 6, 1967, backed by session players, rather than the other members of the group, it was nevertheless included on Buffalo Springfield's second album, Buffalo Springfield Again on Atlantic Records. The album is available on CD, and the song can also be found on Retrospective CD on Elektra. The sound recording is administered by WMG.
