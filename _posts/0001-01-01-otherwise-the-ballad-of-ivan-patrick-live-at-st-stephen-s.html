9.30.79.~10.31.11.<br />•<br />•<br />A lonely road, a desert town<br />Headed out as the sun went down<br />They carried on in a celebration<br />The open road, the destination<br />She wrapped her arms around his waist<br />They rumbled on through time and space<br />You never know what the Angel's scheming<br />Like a blind date with a left lane demon<br /><br />He never saw it coming in the night<br />It's so easy to sacrifice a life<br />He never made it home on fateful ride<br />It's so easy to step into the light<br /><br />Brought him home, laid him down<br />Buried him in the Devil's Town<br />And now I only see him when I'm dreaming<br />Halloween has a whole new meaning<br /><br />He never saw it coming in the night<br />It's so easy to sacrifice a life<br />I never got a chance to say goodbye<br />It's so easy to step into the light<br /><br />I hope you're learning to fly<br />Somewhere up above the wind<br />They say true love will never die<br />Yeah, True Love Never Dies<br /><br />Cuzz, you'll never die<br /><br />He never saw it coming in the night<br />It's so easy to sacrifice a life<br />He never made it home on fateful ride<br />It's so easy to step into the light<br /><br />Never got a chance to say goodbye<br />It's so easy to sacrifice a life<br />Another good man much too young to die<br />It's so easy to step into the light<br />It's oh so easy to step into the light<br />It's much too easy to step into the light<br />•<br />•<br />•<br />#ThinkingOfYou #IvanPatrick #TrueLoveNeverDies #Halloween #Blood #Family #TheMusicBindsUs #UntilWeMeetAgain #StaySafe
