This is a brilliant and difficult puzzle by Osh Tirola - which combines three different puzzle forms!  And Simon gets the blues from a mistake it takes him some minutes to spot!!<br /><br />Play the puzzle here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cracking-the-cryptic.web.app/sudoku/GM8FdqTnMb">https://cracking-the-cryptic.web.app/sudoku/GM8FdqTnMb</a><br /><br />Rules:<br />Normal Sudoku rules apply. In each row/column/9-cell irregular region, two digits must be shaded as &quot;stars&quot;.  These shaded cells cannot touch each other, even diagonally. Purple clues give the sum of the digits in the two shaded cells in their row/column. Grey clues give the sum of the digits sandwiched between the stars in their row/column.<br /><br />**************************************************************<br />The solution video for our Sudoku Hunt is also now available for all $3 patrons and above.
