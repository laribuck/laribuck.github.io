After moving into our new off grid home in May, 2017, we realized that 24 panels with a capacity of 6.2 KW was not enough.  So we designed and ordered 24 more panels with an additional capacity of 6.7 KW.  Most of the equipment arrived soon but the custom made mounts didn't arrive until August.  This video shows my wife and I installing these additional panels.
