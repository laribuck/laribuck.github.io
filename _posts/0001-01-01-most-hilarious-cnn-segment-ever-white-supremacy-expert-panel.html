Number one comedian Sam Johnson is reacting to the most HILARIOUS segment ever on CNN. SE Cupp had an expert panel to discuss the biggest threat this country faces right now; white supremacy. Sam cannot stop laughing throughout this thing. He is convinced it is like some old school SNL or Chappelle Show comedy skit. This is so ridiculous it cannot be real. CNN as always pushing straight up propaganda! Sam does a good job analyzing, dissecting and of course making fun of these weasels! <br /><br />Here's an excerpt from CNN describing the segment:<br />What comes next for America and hate? The federal government lists White supremacy as a top threat to national security, thanks in part to a rise in White nationalism over the past four years. With a new president elected, how does Joe Biden confront the scourge of racism, anti-Semitism, misogyny and xenophobia that President Donald Trump helped stoke? SE Cupp talks to a panel of experts for our CNN Digital video discussion, but first, former White supremacist Chris Buckley writes our CNN Opinion op-ed. According to the US Department of Homeland Security, White supremacy is the biggest security threat facing the United States today based on the number of violent crimes committed. It eclipses all other types of extremism.<br /><br />*If you'd like to Donate to support the channel*<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.paypal.me/TheTrumpParodyGuy">http://www.paypal.me/TheTrumpParodyGuy</a><br /><br />*Join my Mailing List to never miss an upload*<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/xHzAsz">https://goo.gl/xHzAsz</a><br /><br />*Follow me on alt tech platforms*<br />Bitchute: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bitchute.com/channel/NgAx3fiFHesN/">https://www.bitchute.com/channel/NgAx3fiFHesN/</a><br />DLive: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dlive.tv/TheAngryRepublican">https://dlive.tv/TheAngryRepublican</a><br />Rumble: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rumble.com/c/c-303585">https://rumble.com/c/c-303585</a><br /><br />FAIR USE NOTICE This video may contain copyrighted material; the use of which has not been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.
