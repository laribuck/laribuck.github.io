Andrew from Nomad Capitalist answers the question &quot;When should I incorporate my company?&quot; from the perspective of liability, logistics, and taxes.<br /><br />There are important factors that new entrepreneurs often don't even think about, but can cost a LOT of money later!<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Andrew is a party school drop-out, not an attorney, so seek proper legal advice before taking action. <br />If you need help, go to www.nomadcapitalist.com<br /><br />-----<br />ABOUT NOMAD CAPITALIST<br /><br />Andrew Henderson travels to nearly 30 countries every year to stay up to date on the latest legal strategies for entrepreneurs and investors to pay less tax, grow their money faster, and build their personal freedom.<br /><br />Andrew started Nomad Capitalist to help people like you follow his five magic words: &quot;go where you're treated best&quot;. He has personally started foreign companies, opened offshore bank accounts, and obtained multiple second passports.<br /><br />He also learned the hard way that perpetual information seeking is often the biggest barrier to getting the results you want. Many entrepreneurs spend months and even years constantly researching how to pay less in tax or live overseas, but are afraid to make the jump.<br /><br />As a result, they get stuck and keep paying a fortune in taxes and never get the lifestyle they deserve.<br /><br />Nomad Capitalist's Youtube channel is based on Andrew's vision that focusing on the end result, rather than the latest shiny object, is the best way to actually obtain the benefits of the Nomad Capitalist lifestyle.<br /><br />About Andrew: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nomadcapitalist.com/about/">http://www.nomadcapitalist.com/about/</a><br />Our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nomadcapitalist.com">http://www.nomadcapitalist.com</a><br />Our blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nomadcapitalist.com/blog/">http://www.nomadcapitalist.com/blog/</a><br />Work with Andrew: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.holanomad.com/">http://www.holanomad.com/</a>
