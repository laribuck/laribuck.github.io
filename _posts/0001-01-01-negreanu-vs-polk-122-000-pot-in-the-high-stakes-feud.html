This is one of the BIGGEST pots that the pair have played so far in the High Stakes Feud. Who will ship the $122,000 pot? Negreanu gets it in with a strong top pair and Polk calls it off with a monster draw on the turn. <br /><br /><br /><br />This hand really highlights how the solver decisions can change drastically depending on how many bet sizes your opponent might be using. <br /><br /><br />Enter the PokerCoaching Giveaway: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pokercoaching.com/BlackFridayGiveaway">https://pokercoaching.com/BlackFridayGiveaway</a><br /><br /><br />Take advantage of our Black Friday SALE here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pokercoaching.com/BlackFriday">https://pokercoaching.com/BlackFriday</a> <br /><br /><br />Download the Heads Up pre flop charts that I use in this video for FREE too! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pokercoaching.com/hunl">https://pokercoaching.com/hunl</a> <br /><br /><br />POKER COACHING:<br /><br /><br />PokerCoaching.com has grown and now offers top-level coaching from myself, Jonathan Jaffe, Matt Affleck, Faraz Jaka, Michael Acevedo, Lexy Gavin, Tristan Wade, Alex Fitzgerald and Evan Jarvis! <br /><br /><br />Make sure to subscribe to watch the rest of this series as well as Poker Concept Videos, a Weekly Poker Hand Analysis, In-Depth Poker Strategy Videos, A Little Coffee, and much more!
