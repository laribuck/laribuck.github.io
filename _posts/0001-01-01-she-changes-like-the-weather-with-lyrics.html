Lyrics:<br /><br />She's such a lovely sunny day,<br /><br />She makes your clouds evaporate,<br /><br />The condensation really pays,<br /><br />When she makes you feel this way,<br /><br />Like the blue sky up above,<br /><br />She clears your mind with her love,<br /><br />Even your shadow gets caught up,<br /><br />So why does it always have to go?<br /><br />Every place I go its wrote in stone,<br /><br />That there is two sides of every story,<br /><br />So I forget that a sunny day,<br /><br />Is ended when the sun starts falling,<br /><br />Or even when storm clouds start forming.<br /><br />She's such a lovely sunny day,<br /><br />Almost surprised its not been claimed,<br /><br />Tell your friends who are out to play,<br /><br />That there's no chance she might change.<br /><br />Every race I run,<br /><br />I've kept to the post,<br /><br />But then thats another story,<br /><br />So I forget that a sunny day,<br /><br />Is ended when the sun starts falling,<br /><br />Or even when storm clouds start forming.<br /><br />She's such a lovely sunny day,<br /><br />Ended when the sun starts falling,<br /><br />She's such a lovely sunny day,<br /><br />Ended when storm clouds start forming,<br /><br />She's such a lovely sunny day,<br /><br />Ended when the sun starts falling,
