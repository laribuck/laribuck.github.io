But potatoes have played a much more significant role in our history than just that of the dietary staple we have come to know and love today. Leo Bear-McGuinness shares how without the potato, our modern civilization might not exist at all.<br /><br />Lesson by Leo Bear-McGuinness, animation by Black Powder Design.
