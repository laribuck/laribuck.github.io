If you contrast Formula One with Nascar for example, where the origins really came from running moonshine across State lines during the Prohibition, the DNA of F1 is so different.&quot;<br />Briatore agreed: &quot;Everybody wants to be at this race from the sponsors to the celebrities. The Billionaire Club is the center of this event, this party and all this celebrity.<br />&quot;All the drivers are there Sunday night,&quot; he promised.<br />After attending Sunday's royal grand prix gala dinner, hosted by Monaco's Prince Albert II and Princess Charlene, Rosberg, who was raised in Monaco, might have opted to head home to his Monte Carlo pad for an early night.<br />For others the midnight to dawn party at the Billionaire Grand Prix Gala kept on swinging.<br />Read: Nico Rosberg wins Monaco Grand Prix<br />The evening promised world-famous DJs, special performances and inestimable bottles of champagne to quench the thirst of revelers.<br />The Billionaire Club, which stages a four-day fiesta in Monaco, aims to emulate a billionaire lifestyle, but that does not mean you have to have billions in the bank to get in.<br />&quot;If he's a billionaire but he's a billionaire that spends no money -- we are not interested!&quot; Briatore quipped.<br />&quot;The name was a kind of provocative name so everyone can remember. You don't need to be a billionaire.<br />&quot;It is not a rip-off, it's the same price as everything else in Monaco, nothing dramatic.&quot;<br />The club may not be for billionaires per se but it does have a minimum spending policy. The price starts from $4,000 for a standard table.<br />The majority of tables at the Monaco event are reserved for Billionaire Club members and returning guests with 10% held back for what Briatore describes as &quot;last-minute friends.&quot;<br /><br /><br />billionaire lifestyle, billionaire people, billionaire list 2014, list of billionaires in the world, 2014 billionaires list, millionaire lifestyle, billionaires lifestyle, billionaire lifestyle youtube, rich lifestyle, lifestyles of the rich and famous, lifestyle of the rich and famous, rich people lifestyle, lifestyles of the rich and famous lyrics, lifestyle of the rich, billionaire list, young billionaires,
