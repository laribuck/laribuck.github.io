The inspiration to do small acts of kindness should reverberate throughout the community. All people, not just children, communicate better and accept and embrace differences when shown kindness. Kindness creates positive self-worth from within. Bullies won’t exist in a world where kindness is as important as food. But most importantly, kindness inspires risk-taking, creativity and leaders. Let’s create a nation of leaders who care about themselves, others, animals and the environment by simply being kind.<br /><br />Elizabeth Downey-Sunnen spent her life searching for kindness in others only to find kindness begins within.  This search has lead her to far off lands, teaching in France, the United States and Canada from Kindergarten to AP and all points in between.  She has her masters in Education and spends her time between the classroom, her incredibly strong husband, their amazingly brilliant children and their eager-to-learn-but-not-as-bright pets.  You can read her parenting blog at Does Coffee Come in 'Bucket' Size? or just hang out with her on Facebook or Instagram.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
