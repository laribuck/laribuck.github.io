He will help you again. Has He healed you before? He will heal you again”<br /><br />Is your heart troubled? Do you feel it’s the end for you? Are you depressed, oppressed, dejected and rejected?<br /><br />Trusting as the moments fly, Trusting as the days go by, Trusting Him, whatever befall, Trusting Jesus, that is all.<br /><br />If He Did It Before, He Can And Will Do It Again” - Femi
