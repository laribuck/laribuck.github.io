He has just seventeen hours to spin himself back into power, and it's going to be the longest night of his life.<br /><br />All hell has broken loose at Number 10 as the Prime Minister resigns six months too early. Suddenly everyone needs to be best friends with the Nutter faction - headed up by Chief Nutter Tom - if they want to keep their jobs. Or failing that, find someone stupid enough to stand against him and force a leadership contest.<br /><br /><br />The Thick of It | Season 2, Episode 3 | BBC<br /><br />#BBC #TheThickOfIt #SpinnersandLosers<br />All our TV channels and S4C are available to watch live through BBC iPlayer, although some programmes may not be available to stream online due to rights.
