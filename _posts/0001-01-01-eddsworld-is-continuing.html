So, now what?<br /><br />Post 1: goo.gl/D1n5MZ<br />Post 2: goo.gl/V6Kt4g<br /><br />Remember, these people are just people. Don't go harassing anyone because they are taking their time.<br /><br />Apologies for not uploading much recently. I've had lots of school stuff to think about and I've just been really busy in general. I'll be the first to admit that the editing in this one is not great. I'd already done about 95% of the video, but then my video editing software kind of died on me, so I had to make this whole video twice. If I go with this style of in the future, I'll clean up the Tomee Bear avatar and use a different stock background.<br /><br />---<br /><br />MUSIC:<br /><br />Otis McDonald - Not For Nothing<br /><br />The Mamas &amp; The Papas - California Dreamin' (instrumental)<br /><br />Team Fortress 2 OST - More Gun<br /><br />Hotline Miami OST - Deep Cover<br /><br />Finesse - Peyruis
