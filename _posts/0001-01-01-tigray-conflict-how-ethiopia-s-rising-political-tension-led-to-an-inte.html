Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed gave the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) 72-hours to surrender on Monday, amid a mounting conflict that has threatened to destabilize the region and has resulted in tens of thousands of refugees being forced to flee the area.<br /><br />Tensions between the prime minister and the TPLF started to appear shortly after he came to power in 2018, when he introduced sweeping new reforms that marginalized the Tigray region’s political power.<br /><br />After elections were postponed in August, tensions escalated further when Tigray held its own unsanctioned elections.<br /><br />Alyssa Julie explains how rising political tensions led Ethiopia to this crisis and war within its Tigray region, and what it could mean for neighbouring countries in the Horn of Africa.<br /><br />For more info, please go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7465259/25k-ethiopian-refugees-sudan/">https://globalnews.ca/news/7465259/25k-ethiopian-refugees-sudan/</a><br />Subscribe to Global News Channel HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/20fcXDc">http://bit.ly/20fcXDc</a><br /><br />Like Global News on Facebook HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/255GMJQ">http://bit.ly/255GMJQ</a><br /><br />Follow Global News on Twitter HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt">http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt</a><br /><br />Follow Global News on Instagram HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB">https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB</a><br /><br />#Ethiopia #Tigray #EthiopiaConflict #GlobalNews
