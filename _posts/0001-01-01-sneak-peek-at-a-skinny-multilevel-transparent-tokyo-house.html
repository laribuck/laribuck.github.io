When visiting Tokyo, we couldn’t resist taking a peek* at Sou Fujimoto's transparent “House NA” (*from the outside only). <br /><br />From the architect: “Designed for a young couple in a quiet Tokyo neighborhood, the 914 square-foot transparent house contrasts the typical concrete block walls seen in most of Japan’s dense residential areas. Associated with the concept of living within a tree, the spacious interior is comprised of 21 individual floor plates, all situated at various heights, that satisfy the clients desire to live as nomads within their own home.”<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.sou-fujimoto.net/">http://www.sou-fujimoto.net/</a><br /><br />Original story: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://faircompanies.com/videos/a-peek-at-sou-fujimoris-see-through-glass-house-in-tokyo/">https://faircompanies.com/videos/a-peek-at-sou-fujimoris-see-through-glass-house-in-tokyo/</a>
