Hi, Youtube! We are back again! Thanks for pressing on this video, you are back to JayJay finances where we generally talk about stock markets and personal finances.<br /><br />If you recall, almost a month back, there were tons of different kind of articles on social media platforms, different sort of memes presenting the idea of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet (aka Google) and Apple treat market as it would be a monopoly game.<br /> <br />Partly, it would be hard to deny this fact, specifically realizing that those companies are that big that their market capitalization exceeds or equals to countries GDP (which is gross domestic product) that have millions of people in their population and hundreds of thousands in their businesses.<br /> <br />For instance, as we can see here in this extract of an article, if we would broke out by the exact company and their 2019 fiscal year, we have got exact countries as a comparison to make in terms of their GDP. So, for instance, Amazon made 280,5$ billion, which is very close to Pakistan’s GDP, and per 2018 data, Pakistan had population of approximately 212 million of people. <br /><br />Of course, we can say that there’s huge difference between comparing company to country, which is still shall be defined as developing one, but guys we are talking a comparison of one legal entity to the country which has a population of over 200 million of people! That’s crazy!<br /><br />However, this is not the issue I wanted to discuss today – actually, I think it’s not our task to consider how these things shall be handled on higher level. Let’s stay us and let’s find another great opportunity to actually invest our money and in this case receive nothing, but additional gain. <br />As already seen from the headline, Amazon entered the pharmacy business in 2018 with its $753 million acquisition of PillPack, signaling to investors a growing interest in offering prescription medicines directly to consumers. Basically, they are spreading their scope of business, entering one of the largest in the game that definitely has the hugest game-changer mentality. <br /><br />On Tuesday, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced that customers in 45 states will be able to fill their prescriptions through Amazon Pharmacy beginning this week. Delivery to the remaining five states -- Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Minnesota -- should be available over time.<br />The company's decision to launch Amazon Pharmacy builds upon its $1 billion acquisition of PillPack in 2018. A mail-order pharmacy, PillPack specializes in delivering pre-packaged daily medication packets to patients with multiple prescriptions.<br /><br />The new Amazon Pharmacy will offer perks to Amazon Prime members, including faster delivery. Nonmembers can receive prescriptions within five days for free, but Prime members get free two-day delivery, plus savings of up to 80% at checkout. If prescriptions are being transferred from another healthcare company, such as Walgreens or CVS Health, a customer's first delivery could take longer than two days. <br /><br />I honestly believe that having this support on line for 24/7 would definitely increase chances for Amazon to get their market share, as simply people always tend to go where they see more additional bonuses provided and Amazon always does that.<br /><br />Amazon Pharmacy could eventually contribute significantly to revenue. According to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, prescription drug spending increased 3.2% in 2019, and in 2020 is expected to climb 3.7%. Spending is forecast to accelerate to 5.4% per year between 2021 and 2023 because of growing demand and higher prices. <br /><br />Overall, Americans spend over $335 billion annually on prescription medications, a significant proportion through the largest retail pharmacy chains.'<br /><br />Interesting to mention that, pharmacy stocks tumbled following the launch of Amazon Pharmacy. CVS shares fell 8.6% on Tuesday. Walgreens Boots Alliance dropped 9.6%. Shares of Rite Aid slid 16.2%. GoodRx, which helps consumers find discounts on prescription drugs, fell 22.5%. Amazon shares closed slightly higher.<br /><br />Well, let’s be honest: pharmacy industry is probably not the only one that in recent times Amazon will try to make investments and generally expand their businesses. However, as I said, it creates nothing, but marvellous opportunities to actually invest our money in and in this way it shall be expected in the terms of stock price increase. However, we will see how it will end up for the company!<br /><br />If you ended up on being here, I just wanted to say thank you so much for the support given, it means a world to me. I wish you to have a nice remaining week, but right before that, please do not forget to like and subscribe!<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Jay
