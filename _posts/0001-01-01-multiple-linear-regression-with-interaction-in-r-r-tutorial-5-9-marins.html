Either way We Thank You!<br /><br /><br />In this R video tutorial, we will learn how to include interaction or effect modification in a regression model and how to interpret the model coefficients. <br /><br />In statistics, an interaction may arise when considering the relationship among three or more variables and describes a situation in which the effect of one causal variable on an outcome depends on the state of a second causal variable (that is, when effects of the two causes are not additive). Although commonly thought of in terms of causal relationships, the concept of interaction can also describe non-causal associations. Interactions are often considered in the context of regression analyses or factorial experiments.<br /><br /><br />These video tutorials are useful for anyone interested in learning data science and statistics with R programming language using RStudio.<br /><br /><br /><br />‚ñ∫ ‚ñ∫ Watch More:<br /><br />‚ñ∫ Intro to Statistics Course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2SQOxDH">https://bit.ly/2SQOxDH</a><br />‚ñ∫Data Science with R <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/1A1Pixc">https://bit.ly/1A1Pixc</a><br />‚ñ∫Getting Started with R (Series 1): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2PkTneg">https://bit.ly/2PkTneg</a><br />‚ñ∫Graphs and Descriptive Statistics in R (Series 2): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2PkTneg">https://bit.ly/2PkTneg</a><br />‚ñ∫Probability distributions in R (Series 3): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2AT3wpI">https://bit.ly/2AT3wpI</a><br />‚ñ∫Bivariate analysis in R (Series 4): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2SXvcRi">https://bit.ly/2SXvcRi</a><br />‚ñ∫Linear Regression in R (Series 5): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/1iytAtm">https://bit.ly/1iytAtm</a><br />‚ñ∫ANOVA Concept and with R <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2zBwjgL">https://bit.ly/2zBwjgL</a><br />‚ñ∫Hypothesis Testing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Ff3J9e">https://bit.ly/2Ff3J9e</a><br />‚ñ∫Linear Regression Concept and with R Lectures <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2z8fXg1">https://bit.ly/2z8fXg1</a><br /><br />Follow MarinStatsLectures<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/4vDQzT">https://goo.gl/4vDQzT</a><br />website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://statslectures.com">https://statslectures.com</a><br />Facebook:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/qYQavS">https://goo.gl/qYQavS</a><br />Twitter:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/393AQG">https://goo.gl/393AQG</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/fdPiDn">https://goo.gl/fdPiDn</a><br /><br />Our Team: <br />Content Creator: Mike Marin (B.Sc., MSc.)
