hello my little stars :)<br />i finally got Entity into a full animation meme by themselves, which is cool. I wanted to name this meme IdENTITY.. get it? identity.. entity.. get it? haha but.. theres identities meme, so uh, frick.<br /><br />If you are interested, I have a very, very long backstory about Entity. I am a story writer, so please tell me what you think!<br /><br />I love making lore out of the blue, but some factors need to be really thought about before setting it in stone. Some details are unknowns, and are encouraged for subscribers to theorize. Also some of the details that i stated might change as well. All in the process to creating a new story! (I already started changing stuff)<br /><br />WARNING: Blood, suicide, unusual self harm<br /><br />Entity was once a male human (real name unknown). He was an outstanding and athletic student who got into the NASA program and eventually became an astronaut. <br />He and other astronauts were sent on a mission (unknown destination) Along the way or at their destination already, Entity was sent out alone (either to fix or get something) and ran across something that sucked his spirit out of his body, becoming pure black. It lost his gender, it's voice, and most of it's emotions. It also got digitigrade hoofed legs.<br />Entity went back to it's crew in a panic, but Entity's human self no longer existed (the crew couldn't see Entity). In a fit of rage and agony, Entity suddenly entered every crew mate's mind. Somehow, Entity killed everyone on that ship, including a friend. (im thinking everyone went crazy from all of Entity's attempts to communicate and killed themselves)<br />Ingulfed in grief and hopelessness, it tried to kill itself as well. This resulted in it's face being torn apart. This did not kill it, and it felt no pain. It was now unable to see or smell. <br />Years passed wandering/ floating space blindly, Entity found out it was actually quite powerful. From space dust, it crafted a skull face for itself. This gave Entity the ability to see again, possibly something along the lines of space rock mirrors reflecting light)<br />Finding his way back to Earth, it gained information on it's space crew. They were all deemed dead. (bc they were lol)<br />Entity has somewhat lost it's humanity, loosing the concept &quot;nice.&quot; It has been through too much, and decided to start existing however it wanted. it roams people's minds, including animals. It conjures the power to create potions out of thin air. The reason he can make potions out of nothing is because it doesn't exist and is now part of this void where the laws of physics don't apply.<br /><br />It feels how strongly people feel about a specific thing, and gives them a potion to bring them closer to their desire, but not directly to the desire. It communicates to others by speaking within the mind of the person in their voice.<br />Overtime, Entity has gathered this dimensional empire. These people and animals whom Entity helped declared Entity as their savior and leader. Yet, after all this time (about 20 years or so) it is seeking for what took his spirit away, only partially remembering what was real about itself, and doubting it ever was real.<br /><br />So.. that's where the animation starts. He's just thinking about his past. haha.. fun.<br />thanks so much for reading<br /><br />song: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/_F9IO9Plldc">https://youtu.be/_F9IO9Plldc</a><br />...<br /><br />FAQ:<br />- What do you animate with? (Flipaclip)<br />- Fps? (12)<br />- Age? (16)<br />- Birthday? (July 16)<br />- Pronouns? (She/Her)<br />- How long have I been animating? (Almost 5 years)<br />- How did I start animating? (After moving on from making animation memes on Instagram, I made MAP parts on Youtube)<br />- How do you make it so smooth? (Squash and stretch, easing in and out, consistent anatomy, etc)<br />- What inspired your art style? (Mainly Voltron)<br />- Is animating your job? (Drawing is, not animating, animating is a hobby)
