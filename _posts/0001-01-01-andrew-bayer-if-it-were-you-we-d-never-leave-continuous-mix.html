Ane Brun) through to the epic, cinematic builds of “Gaff’s Eulogy” each track tells is own story and stirs with emotion; Bayer blends the organic with the electronic in a way few producers master. A contemplative and absorbing electronica LP, the full journey demands and rewards repeat listens.<br /><br />1. Andrew Bayer 'Opening Act'<br />2. Andrew Bayer 'Doomsday'<br />3.
