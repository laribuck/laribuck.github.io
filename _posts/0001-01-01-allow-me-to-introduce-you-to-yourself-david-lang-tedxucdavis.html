In addition, Dr. Lang routinely teaches various courses at UC, Davis, in the Economics, Statistics, and Mathematics Departments.

Dr. Langâ€™s research interests reside most generally in the field of Applied Microeconomics with a specific focus on how and why individuals make the choices that they make as well as looking into the specific incentives that they face and how this might influence future outcomes. Dr. Lang received his BA in economics at Stanford University and both his MA and PhD in Economics from Washington University in St. Louis. <br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
