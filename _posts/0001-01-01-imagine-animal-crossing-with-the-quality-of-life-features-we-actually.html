Imagine an Animal Crossing: New Horizons Direct, except they announce the kinds of Quality of Life changes that players have been begging for since the game's release. #ImagineAnimalCrossing<br /><br />Got any cool ideas for new features? Mention it in the comments, on my Patreon, or on Twitter with the hashtag #ImagineAnimalCrossing, and I may animate and include it in the next video!<br /><br />THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL NINTENDO DIRECT. The goal of this video is not to mislead, but to demonstrate that these changes can realistically be implemented such that it improves the player experience while maintaining the spirit and atmosphere of Animal Crossing: New Horizons.<br /><br />Voice cast (in order of appearance):<br />• KIRA BUCKLAND — ( Twitter: @KiraBuckland | YT: @Lady Stardust )<br />• LIZZIE FREEMAN — ( Twitter: @LizzieRFreeman | YT: @LizzieBiz )<br />• MADELINE DORROH — ( Twitter: @madelinedorroh | YT: @veritaffle )<br /><br />Produced, written, filmed, animated, and edited by:<br />• NICK HA — ( Twitter: @NickHaFIM | Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/nickha">https://www.patreon.com/nickha</a> ) <br /><br />Additional editing and animation by:<br />• SERENA BELLAMY<br /><br />#AnimalCrossing
