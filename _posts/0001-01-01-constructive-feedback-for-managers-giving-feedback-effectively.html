Its findings are insightful:<br /><br />- When a manager gives little or no feedback, the manager fails to engage 98% of employees.<br />- Four out of ten employees who receive little or no feedback become actively disengaged.<br />- Managers who concentrate on strengths when giving feedback are 30 times more likely to engage their employees than those giving no feedback.<br />- One in ten managers concentrates on weaknesses when providing feedback.<br /><br />The conclusion drawn by the study is that the tools, techniques, and strategies that a manager uses when giving feedback have a huge impact on employee engagement.<br /><br />In this article Iâ€™ll discuss why feedback is crucial, the basis of an effective feedback strategy, and one of the key tools that provide a framework for constructive feedback.
