Virtuosity means masterly perfection, the highest degree of artistic skills. It is a special state where the artist overcomes technical difficulties without extra effort to fully indulge in the joy of music making.<br /><br />At Haydn's concerts, barriers were set up to control the frantic crowd.<br /><br />But live instruments have fallen into the background by the 21st century.<br /><br />At the same time, there are three artists who feel a burning desire to prove that classical music has not lost anything from its power and that classical instruments have a place in today's mainstream musical world.<br /><br />This is the Rise of the Instruments. <br /><br />---<br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/HAVASI">https://www.facebook.com/HAVASI</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.havasi.eu">http://www.havasi.eu</a><br /><br />---<br /><br />Rise of the Instruments<br /><br />Composed and performed by: HAVASI<br /><br />Featuring:<br /><br />Dohnanyi Symphony Orchestra Budafok<br />Tina Guo, Cello<br />Peter Pejtsik, Cello<br />Endi, Drums<br /><br />Producer and Creative Director: Csaba Marjai<br />Costume Designer: Tamas Naray<br />Film Director: Laszlo Krisko<br />D.O.P.: Zoltan Csincsi<br />Sound Engineer: Gabor Juhos<br />Music Production Director: Miklos Lukacs
