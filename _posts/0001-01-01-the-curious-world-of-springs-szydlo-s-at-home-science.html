This week, Andrew takes us on a journey exploring a seemingly simple object - the spring.<br /><br />From pocket-watches, to the suspension of a vintage car, these simple mechanical objects have a huge number of uses still in our modern world, from storing energy to giving you a smooth drive. There is of course a little bit of action from the blow torch (it wouldn't be a video from Andrew Szydlo without some fire) and lots of interesting mechanical explorations along the way too.<br /><br />Chapters:<br />00:00 - A spring driven pocketwatch<br />04:04 - John Harrison and the first chronometer<br />06:00 - Mainsprings and hairsprings<br />09:20 - Spring driven toys<br />15:43 - Investigating a broken mainspring<br />19:22 - An introduction to metallurgy<br />23:10 - Experiments with spring steel<br />30:05 - Leaf spring suspension<br />34:00 - Helical suspension springs<br /><br />Andrew Szydlo is a chemist and secondary school teacher at Highgate School, well-loved by pupils and Ri attendees alike. He has given public lectures around the country, been featured on TV shows and has become a popular regular face on our channel.<br /><br />Subscribe for regular science videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/RiSubscRibe">http://bit.ly/RiSubscRibe</a><br /><br />The Ri is on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheRoyalInstitution">https://www.patreon.com/TheRoyalInstitution</a><br />and Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/ri_science">http://twitter.com/ri_science</a><br />and Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/royalinstitution">http://www.facebook.com/royalinstitution</a><br />and Tumblr: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ri-science.tumblr.com/">http://ri-science.tumblr.com/</a><br />Our editorial policy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.rigb.org/home/editorial-policy">http://www.rigb.org/home/editorial-policy</a><br />Subscribe for the latest science videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/RiNewsletter">http://bit.ly/RiNewsletter</a>
