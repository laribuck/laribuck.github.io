A scripture reference I was thinking of when recording this song is Matthew 10:8.<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />God forgave my sin, in Jesus name<br />I've been born again, in Jesus name<br />And in Jesus name I come to you<br />To share His love as He told me to<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />He said freely, freely you have received<br />Freely, freely give<br />Go in My name and because you believe<br />Others will know that I live<br /><br />All power is given, in Jesus name<br />In earth and heaven, in Jesus name<br />And in Jesus name I come to you<br />To share His power as He told me to [chorus]<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />If you enjoyed this video, please click the Like button and Subscribe to our channel.
