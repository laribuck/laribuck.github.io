Since I didn’t have my “Do Not Disturb” settings properly on my phone my first video got interrupted by a phone call... unbeknownst to me until after I had completed several more pulls. *Sigh* oh well. Once my daughter figured out my deficiencies in my settings for me, and after enough time had passed that the wound had healed, I got back on the saddle to record again, hoping to replicate some of what was lost. But today had other plans... lol you’ll see. I included some footage I might not’ve otherwise because I found it humorous, maybe you will too. Thanks for watching! I truly appreciate every view I get because it is my connection to people with similar interests!
