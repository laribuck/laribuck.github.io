I travel to Alex Pole's blacksmith shop in Somerset, aptly named &quot;The Forge&quot; where he teaches me beginner blacksmithing tips like how to use a coal forge, how to use a hammer and anvil and most importantly, how to forge a nail by hand! I learnt so much on this adventure, and it truly made me appreciate the skill and craft of our ancestors. Stay tuned for more videos with Alex down the road...<br /><br />Alex's Forge: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.alexpoleironwork.com/">https://www.alexpoleironwork.com/</a><br />Alex's YouTube Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIIRulQA5ZmCYO_n2PRTskQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIIRulQA5ZmCYO_n2PRTskQ</a><br />Alex's Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/alexpoleironwork/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/alexpoleironwork/?hl=en</a><br />Alex's Forged Kitchenware: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.alexpoleironwork.com/collections/shop">https://www.alexpoleironwork.com/collections/shop</a><br /><br />TA OUTDOORS BUSHCRAFT &amp; CAMPING GEAR SHOP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.taoutdoors.com/shop/">https://www.taoutdoors.com/shop/</a><br />TA OUTDOORS MERCHANDISE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://taofficial.com">https://taofficial.com</a> <br /><br />Our other YouTube Channel: Dad's Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/tafishing">https://www.youtube.com/tafishing</a><br /><br />My Bushcraft, Survival and Filming Gear (Amazon): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/taoutdoors">https://www.amazon.com/shop/taoutdoors</a><br />These are amazon affiliate links<br /><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/taoutdoorofficial">https://www.instagram.com/taoutdoorofficial</a><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/totallyawesomeoutdoors">https://www.facebook.com/totallyawesomeoutdoors</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/OutdoorsTa">https://twitter.com/OutdoorsTa</a><br /><br />#blacksmithing #forge #forging #nail #taoutdoors
