Hey guys, if you would, please take a few minutes and watch this very educational video from my shopping experience at Macy's department store the other day.<br /><br />If you want to learn how to give helpful directions to someone who is blind, in this video you will see/hear Real life examples of things not to do and things you should do in those types of situations.<br /><br />Video description… In the first part of the video you'll hear me ask a sales associate for directions to the elevator. Listen to her response! She gave me directions that were not possible for  a completely blind individual to understand. Next, you'll see/hear a very polite customer who offered me assistance to the elevator. Then, after Antonia and I found our way out of the elevator and downstairs on the main level, you will see/hear other individuals who tried to give us helpful directions to where we were wanting to go. Some of the directions were very helpful and others were not. <br /><br />Let me just say, when you are helping someone who cannot see anything, words like &quot;over there&quot;, &quot;on the back wall&quot;, or &quot;Go straight and turn right&quot;, are just not detailed enough for a blind person to understand. <br /><br />Remember, if you are completely blind, it is very easy to be disoriented, especially if you are in an unfamiliar place, that is why it is very necessary to give the blind individual orientation to the area when giving detailed directions. <br /><br />PS. To truly understand what I'm talking about, you need to watch the entire video. If you have any questions after watching this video on how to appropriately assist the blind, please feel free to comment Below. And I believe I can speak for everyone in the blind Community when I say… If you do not know how to help or give us assistance, there is absolutely nothing wrong with asking. In fact, if I were you, that would be the best place to start! Thank you :-)
