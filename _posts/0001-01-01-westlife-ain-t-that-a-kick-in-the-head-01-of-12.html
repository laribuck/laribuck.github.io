Track 1 Allow us to be Frank Album 2004<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />How lucky can one guy be? <br /><br />I kissed her and she kissed me. <br /><br />Like the fella once said <br /><br />Ain't that a kick in the head? <br /><br /><br /><br />The room was completely black, <br /><br />I hugged her and she hugged back. <br /><br />Like a sailor said quote <br /><br />Ain't that a hole in a boat? <br /><br /><br /><br />My head keeps spinnin', <br /><br />I go to sleep I keep grinnin' <br /><br />If this is just the beginnin' <br /><br />My life is gonna be beautiful. <br /><br /><br /><br />I've sunshine enough to spread, <br /><br />It's just like the fella said. <br /><br />And be quick <br /><br />Ain't love a kick in the head? <br /><br /><br /><br />Like the fella once said <br /><br />Ain't that a kick in the head? <br /><br /><br /><br />Like the sailor said quote <br /><br />Ain't that a hole in a boat? <br /><br /><br /><br />My head keeps spinnin', <br /><br />I go to sleep I keep grinnin' <br /><br />If this is just the beginnin' <br /><br />My life is gonna be beautiful. <br /><br /><br /><br />She's telling me we'll be wed, <br /><br />She's picked out a king-size bed, <br /><br />I couldn't feel any better or I'd be sick. <br /><br /><br /><br />Tell me quick, <br /><br />Oh, ain't love a kick...? <br /><br />Tell me quick, <br /><br />Ain't love a kick in the head?
