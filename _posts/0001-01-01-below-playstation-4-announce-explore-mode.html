BELOW, Capy’s dark &amp; deadly dungeon crawler, is coming to the Playstation 4 this spring, along with a brand new mode called EXPLORE, geared for players who value discovery over difficulty. <br /><br />EXPLORE Mode features these changes to BELOW’s core rules:<br /><br />- Reduced Survival Mechanics: No Hunger or Thirst.<br />- Traps, Damage &amp; Death: No instant kills + All damage depletes player Health slowly through bleeding, giving players a chance to recover.<br />- Permanent Bonfire Checkpoints: Checkpoints can always be returned to after death, allowing players to continue progressing deeper into the underworld.<br /><br />BELOW's original SURVIVE Mode exists in its pure, untouched form for player's excited to test their mettle against BELOW’s original challenge.<br /><br />EXPLORE Mode is also coming to the Xbox One and Steam.
