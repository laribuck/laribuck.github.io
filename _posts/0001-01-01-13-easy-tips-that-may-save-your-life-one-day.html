It's likely to loosen the cords a bit, and you'll be able to remove the ties.<br />- If you find yourself with frostbite, take care of it as soon as you can. Despite the popular misconception, do NOT pour hot water on the damaged skin – it’ll make things much worse!<br />- If you run out of water in the wilderness, your top priority is to find a source of it. Keep in mind that water always runs downhill.<br />- If you get lost in the wilderness and have no idea what direction to choose, find a stream or a small creek. Follow it until it merges with a larger river.<br />- Dip the matches into hot wax and let them dry. It’ll make them waterproof, and to use one, you'll just have to scrape the wax off the match head.<br />- The heat coming from your fire will cause the rocks to expand. Eventually, they’ll give in, and you may get trapped in a rockfall or a landslide.<br />- If you find yourself surrounded by snow and with no drinking water on hand, eating snow is NOT the best way to rehydrate. In fact, it’ll most likely lead to further dehydration!<br />- If you’re restrained and lying in a puddle of mud or muddy water, arch your back. This posture will help the air get to your lungs faster and more easily. <br />- As soon as you realize you're lost in the woods during a hike, immediately stop. It may sound counterintuitive, but the best solution isn't to keep walking. <br />- There’s an &quot;Urban Survival Myth&quot; that it's safe to drink saltwater in small amounts. But in reality, such a delusion can have very dramatic consequences.<br />- When you go on a hike or decide to spend several days camping, pack your bag with some extra stuff for unpredicted situations. <br />- Opt for products that don't weigh a lot, like dried fruit and peanut butter or beef jerky.<br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Stock materials (photos, footages and other):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com">https://www.shutterstock.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eastnews.ru">https://www.eastnews.ru</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>
