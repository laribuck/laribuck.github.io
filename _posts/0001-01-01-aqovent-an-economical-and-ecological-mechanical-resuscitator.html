Today, as the country battles the COVID-19 pandemic, we extend our support to the nation with the launch of AQovent™, an oxygen-driven emergency resuscitator that can provide constant-flow, pressure-cycled ventilation automatically to patients in respiratory distress. Aequs has manufactured these resuscitators in India based on the license procured on the concept design from the University of Illinois, U.S.A.
