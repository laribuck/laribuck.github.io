I just lacked motivation to go play. My body is a ball of knots. Life stress, life problems and work issues creep into your life and the golf is secondary. Then it starts falling to pieces. <br /><br />But it's time for a change. So I saw Michele Low for an on-course lesson at TPC Kuala Lumpur. In this new series, I will delve into what I am going to do until the end of the year to get my game in order. That will be swing lessons, body development, and on course work with pro's and whoever. <br /><br />The Greatest Apparel and Accessories in Golf:<br />APPAREL &amp; ACCESSORIES: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://waddaplayagolf.com">https://waddaplayagolf.com</a><br />T-SHIRTS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/golfsidekick">https://teespring.com/stores/golfsidekick</a><br /><br /><br />FB GROUP:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/waddaplaya/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/waddaplaya/</a><br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/golfsidekick/">https://www.instagram.com/golfsidekick/</a><br />URL: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://golfsidekick.com/">https://golfsidekick.com/</a><br /><br />I want to get better and I need a more balanced life as work and this nonsense of the mask-wearing virus has separated me from my loved ones and caused a lot fo work stress.  This is the first step. From this on course lesson I learned a few amazing things:<br /><br />My putting needs work and Michele fixed it - now I have somehting to go work on.<br /><br />My swing needs to be adjusted. I want to get rid of the sway in my swing which is a consequence of playing sports and also from a poor lifestyle of sitting for the last few years. I will see a swing coach.<br /><br />Michele was practically showing me the way of the playa. It highlighted how far I have moved away from the path of the Way of the Playa because my brain is so scattered with other work and life stress when I do get to the golf course.<br /><br />There is so much value in this video and Michele is a superb coach.
