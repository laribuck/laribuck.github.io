► My Sequences &amp; Series course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kristakingmath.com/sequences-and-series-course">https://www.kristakingmath.com/sequences-and-series-course</a><br /><br />Learn how to determine whether a sequence is increasing, decreasing, or not monotonic. We'll also talk about whether we can say that the sequence is bounded above and/or whether it's bounded below.<br /><br />● ● ● GET EXTRA HELP ● ● ●<br /><br />If you could use some extra help with your math class, then check out Krista’s website // <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.kristakingmath.com">http://www.kristakingmath.com</a><br /><br />● ● ● CONNECT WITH KRISTA ● ● ●<br /><br />Hi, I’m Krista! I make math courses to keep you from banging your head against the wall. ;)<br /><br />Math class was always so frustrating for me. I’d go to a class, spend hours on homework, and three days later have an “Ah-ha!” moment about how the problems worked that could have slashed my homework time in half. I’d think, “WHY didn’t my teacher just tell me this in the first place?!”<br /><br />So I started tutoring to keep other people out of the same aggravating, time-sucking cycle. Since then, I’ve recorded tons of videos and written out cheat-sheet style notes and formula sheets to help every math student—from basic middle school classes to advanced college calculus—figure out what’s going on, understand the important concepts, and pass their classes, once and for all.
