In this video, I have combined Aristotle and The Art of War by Sun Tzu together as strategy and tactics - the basis of any human interaction in life, as well as conflicts and war. Everything in art comes down to actions, as in life, and as in strategy. In the end, it is all about our actions and the actions of others. If you have a hard time understanding this concept, or you have a hard time understanding how to assess your actions as they are seen by others (not yourself), and how the actions of others are seen by others (not you and not the self-assessment of the person being assessed/judged). Is the majority always a good basis, not always, at least on the surface, but underneath (beyond culture and personality) most people are fairly good, overall, and can be used as a populace for a sample for what is considered good actions or the reverse. Aristotle says that the line of vice and virtue separates us all, but the line has a different height for each person, so you must draw a conclusive estimate from a majority.
