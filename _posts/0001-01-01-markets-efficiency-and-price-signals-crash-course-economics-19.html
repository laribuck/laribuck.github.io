Adriene and Jacob teach you all about markets. So, in free market(ish) economies like the United States and most of the world, markets are a big deal. Markets work to produce the stuff that consumers want, and that society needs. Today we'll talk about productive and allocative efficiency, skinny jeans, price signals, and more in this information-dense installment of Crash Course.<br /><br />Crash Course is on Patreon!
