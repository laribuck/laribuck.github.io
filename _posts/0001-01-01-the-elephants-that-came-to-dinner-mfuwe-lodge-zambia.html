The Elephants that came to dinner | Mfuwe Lodge, Zambia<br />At a five-star lodge in Zambia, a bizarre phenomenon is stumping wildlife experts and delighting tourists. An elephant family, led by a matriarch named Wonky Tusk, is overtaking the lobby. Though elephants can be violent in the wild, here they climb the stairs of Mfuwe Lodge and grace past reception without bumping a chair. Why the paradox? Wildlife cameraman Nathan Pilcher is on a mission to find out. What he discovers may reveal elephants to be far more intelligent than we could've imagined.<br /><br />---<br />Contributor : Aquavision TV Productions<br />Footage available at : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.aquavision.co.za">http://www.aquavision.co.za</a><br />Contact us at : library@aquavision.co.za<br /><br />---<br />About Aquavision's Nature Archive<br />Aquavision is an extensive niche collection of 16,000+ hours; HD and UltraHD 4K+ stock footage focusing on Conservation, Wildlife, Oceanic and Cultural media.
