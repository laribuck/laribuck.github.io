Tender Danish Pork Filet Steaks In A Delicious Mustard Sauce | You can never go wrong with succulent pork filet steaks. A mouth-watering example from Denmark involves serving the tender steaks with an exquisite mustard sauce, fresh mushrooms and crispy roast potatoes — that's certainly enough to get any dyed-in-the-wool carnivore excited! As you'll see, those Danes certainly know how to do more than rødgrød, smørrebrød, and kanelsnegle.<br /><br />Bookmark Recipe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.scrumdiddlyumptious.com/danish-filet-steaks/">https://www.scrumdiddlyumptious.com/danish-filet-steaks/</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching and don't forget to subscribe for a first-hand look at all our best recipes and cooking hacks: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/scrumdiddlyumptious?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/scrumdiddlyumptious?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />******************************************************<br /><br />You'll Need:<br /><br />- 10 oz potatoes<br />- 1 onion<br />- 1 tbsp butter<br />- 1 tsp parsley<br />- salt<br />- pepper<br /><br />For the meat:<br /><br />- 1 lb pork fillet<br />- 2 tbsp flour<br />- 1 tsp salt<br />- ½ tsp pepper<br /><br />For the sauce:<br /><br />- 8 oz mushrooms<br />- 1 oz butter<br />- 2 tsp mustard<br />- 6 fl oz water<br />- 3 fl oz cream cheese<br /><br />You'll also need:<br /><br />- 2 tbsp oil for frying<br /><br />Here's How:<br /><br />1. First, remove all the sinew and fat from the pork filet. Cut the filet into three parts and press each one flat.<br /><br />2. Sprinkle flour, salt and pepper onto a cutting board and turn the meat over in the mixture. Shake off the meat well afterwards so that none of the mixture ends up in the pan.<br /><br />3. Brown butter in a pan and fry both sides of the pork filets for 2 minutes on a high heat. Switch down to a medium hear setting and cook the meat for a further 2 minutes.<br /><br />4. Slice the mushroom and sear them in some butter. Add water, cream cheese, mustard, salt and pepper. Leave the sauce to simmer for 5 minutes before placing the pork filets in the pan. Leave them in the sauce for 5 minutes.<br /><br />5. Wash the potatoes and cut them into thin slices. Add some oil to a pan and fry the potatoes on a medium heat for 4 minutes until they are crispy. Just before the potatoes are done, add the onions and butter. Season the potatoes well. Garnish with fresh parsley.<br /><br />The combination of pork filet, mustard sauce, mushrooms and potatoes is a true winner.
