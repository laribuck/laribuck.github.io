Willie Nelson's official music video for &quot;Ride Me Back Home&quot;<br />Listen to Willie Nelson: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://WillieNelson.lnk.to/_listenYD">https://WillieNelson.lnk.to/_listenYD</a><br /><br />Ride Me Back Home available June 21. Buy/listen: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://WillieNelson.lnk.to/RIDEAY">https://WillieNelson.lnk.to/RIDEAY</a><br /><br />Ride Me Back Home is another incredible addition to Willie Nelson’s legendary catalog that finds him working once again with producer Buddy Cannon. Ride Me Back Home sits beside 2017’s God’s Problem Child and 2018’s Last Man Standing as a trilogy of superior songcraft exploring ideas of mortality with wisdom, empathy and a winking love of life. Nelson and Cannon co-wrote a handful of songs but also call on their favorite songsmiths…great writers with great stories to tell: Sonny Throckmorton, Guy Clark, Mac Davis, Buzz Rabin. The result is a magical collection of tunes with emphasis on the lyric. Backed by an amazing band of Nashville gunslingers, Ride Me Back Home finds Willie Nelson making some of the most inspired work of his career.<br /><br />Subscribe to the Willie Nelson YouTube Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://WillieNelson.lnk.to/subscribeYD">https://WillieNelson.lnk.to/subscribeYD</a><br /><br />Follow Willie Nelson: <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://WillieNelson.lnk.to/follow_JB/facebook">https://WillieNelson.lnk.to/follow_JB/facebook</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://WillieNelson.lnk.to/follow_JB/instagram">https://WillieNelson.lnk.to/follow_JB/instagram</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://WillieNelson.lnk.to/follow_JB/twitter">https://WillieNelson.lnk.to/follow_JB/twitter</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://WillieNelson.lnk.to/follow_JB/websitegeneral">https://WillieNelson.lnk.to/follow_JB/websitegeneral</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://WillieNelson.lnk.to/follow_JB/spotify">https://WillieNelson.lnk.to/follow_JB/spotify</a><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://WillieNelson.lnk.to/_subscribeYD">https://WillieNelson.lnk.to/_subscribeYD</a><br /><br />Lyrics:<br />He rode into battle, barebacked and saddled<br />You took the wound in your side<br />You pulled the sleds and you pulled the wagons<br />You gave ‘em somewhere to hide<br />Now they don’t need you and there’s no one to feed you<br />And there’s fences where you used to roam<br />And I wish I could gather up all of your brothers<br />And you would just ride me back home<br /> <br />Chorus:<br />Ride me back home to a much better place<br />Blue skies and sunshine and plenty of space<br />Somewhere where they would just leave you alone<br />Somewhere that you could call home<br />And you would just ride me back home<br /> <br />I got a small place up in the foothills<br />Where green grass is precious as gold<br />I paid a fortune for what little I got here<br />But you know that I’d sell my soul<br />To have all the mountains, the rivers and valleys<br />The places where you need to roam<br />Well I would just gather up all of your brothers<br />And you would just ride me back home<br /><br />Video credits:<br />Production company: New Spacesuit<br />Director: New Spacesuit<br />Producer: New Spacesuit<br /><br />#WillieNelson #RideMeBackHome #Country
