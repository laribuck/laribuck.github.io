Franz Schubert : Sonata in a minor , D 821<br />Allegro moderato   00:00<br />Adagio                     09:44<br />Allegretto                13:39<br /><br />In 1824, disappointed by the recent failure of his opera, Alfonso und Estrella (despite the fact that he considered it one of his finest works), Schubert returned to instrumental music on a smaller scale. As Bach had been stimulated by the recent invention of a five-string cello to emphasise the Sixth Suite’s position as the crowning glory of the set by writing in a higher register for the instrument than in the previous five suites, Schubert was clearly motivated by the arrival of the six-stringed arpeggione, a bowed instrument with the extended range and possibility of fast and accurate leaps and runs facilitated by its guitar-like stringing. It seems likely that Schubert typically wrote this sonata largely as a friendly gesture towards the instrument’s inventor, Vincenz Schuster .<br />The Arpeggione Sonata was written in 1824, soon after the Schöne Müllerin song cycle and shortly before the Great C major Symphony of 1825-28 and the C major String Quintet of 1827, perhaps his finest instrumental works. Melange of  wiener knepien-kultur, volksmusik, russian fairy-tales, hungarian csardas , symphonic tone  poem (the theme of the second movement  is clearly derived from the Larghetto of Beethoven’s Second Symphony) ,  all ending with an entrancing wiegenlied. Arpeggione Sonata elevated instrumental program music to an aesthetic level that could be regarded as equivalent to, or higher than his own songs. <br /><br /><br />Recorded at Villa Delfini in Cavezzo (Modena) ,  august 6th, 2020 <br />Guitars used for this recording: <br />Bernhard Kresse , after Johann Anton Stauffer  (Pavel Steidl)<br />Gabriele Lodi , after René Lacôte  (Edin Karamazov)<br />Open Reel Records - Sound recording and Film making by Marco Taio<br />Produced by Edin Karamazov &amp; Pavel Steidl - © 2020
