Joseph and his partner Monica flew over to Europe from Australia on 5th August for a special trip. He planned on popping the question in London so asked for some help from his family. Mum, Claire, hired TopSecret to create something really beautiful for them.  Our gorgeous ballerina Sophie started the performance and what happened next was amazing. This Australian couple brought London to a standstill for a few minutes - all in the name of romance, of course!<br /><br />Josephs' sister Lea and cousin Paige also flew over without anyone knowing and sported two of our Will You Marry Me T-Shirts to add to the excitement. Everyone absolutely loved creating this stunning flash mob wedding proposal in Piccadilly, London.<br /><br />Jospeh &amp; Monica's song is Smoke FIlled Room by American band Mako and TopSecret arranged a special message from bandleader Alex to add to the surprise. <br /><br />Congratulations to this lovely couple from all the crew @ TopSecret<br /><br />Info &amp; Bookings:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.topsecretagent.co.uk">http://www.topsecretagent.co.uk</a><br /><br />Music: Smoke Filled Room: Mako<br />Message from Alex @ 5.01
