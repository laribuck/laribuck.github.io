That’s why it’s essential that you learn how to deadlift, and how to deadlift properly in order to lift the most amount of weight and minimize or risk of injury – leading to better gains in the long run. In this video I’ll go through 5 of the most common deadlift mistakes people make, but more importantly I’ll show you how to fix them in order to get a bigger, stronger deadlift. It’s likely that you’re doing at least one of the mistakes shown in this video, but as you may experience, fixing it can definitely lead to an increase in your deadlift strength and remove any discomfort you may have been previously feeling. So pay attention!
