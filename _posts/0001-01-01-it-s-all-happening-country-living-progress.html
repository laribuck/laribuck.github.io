By God's grace, we are - step by step - accomplishing what we set out to do. One large expense after another and somehow we have enough each step of the pay. It reminds me of the five loaves and two fishes. <br /><br />We believe God will aid and empower us in the development of this new property. We believe He will do the same for those who walk righteously, have faith in Him and claim His promises. <br /><br />Knowing His will, we have set out to accomplish it...not waiting for better times or all of the many obstacles to first be removed. We use everything we've been entrusted with (time, talents, resources and opportunities). We face and overcome obstacles week by week. It's not always pleasant, yet we persevere.<br /><br />In today's video, we share some of the recent milestones in the development of this new piece of property. May God be with you in your own country living journey. May He give you faith to believe that &quot;God will help His people to find such homes outside the cities.&quot; Adventist Home, p. 139.<br /><br />If you'd like to follow us in our faith journey, feel free to &quot;subscribe&quot; and click the notification bell.
