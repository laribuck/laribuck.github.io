(Contains strong language)<br /><br />Radio 1 joins SLAVES halfway through their sold out UK headlining tour in the middle of November, as they gear up for one of their customarily sweaty and frenzied gigs in front of thousands of their loyal fans.<br /><br />With intimate access to the boys’ world, we start the day in the homes of Isaac and Laurie on the morning of the gig, we then hit the road heading to gig that was to make headlines in the British music press, and subsequently threaten the remaining dates of their tour in this country and abroad.<br /><br />Access all areas and fully immersed in the highs and lows of life on the road, where sometimes things go exactly to plan, and sometimes they don’t... this was the day Isaac knackered his shoulder stage diving, and we were there to film it.  (Get well soon Isaac!)
