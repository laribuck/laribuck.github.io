Assassins creed valhalla is the latest release from ubisoft and the latest addition to the assassins creed series of games. The game is very similar to AC odyssey in the way that it draws from the quest structuring and experience of the witcher 3. So what on earth is the spiffing brit doing in a medieval and Viking infested england which is home to constant raids from vikings and very wealthy monasteries in need of raiding. Now this video is going to be dedicated to discovering if assasin's creed valhalla is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or if breaking the betting mechanics of drinking challenges is broken. Because something tells me players should not be able to make thousands every few mins by just tapping the space bar. But what do you do when you have infinite money well its actually pretty easy to invest your new unlimited silver and infinite cash! Simply purchase every single crafting resource like iron and leather and use it to power level all your items to stupid levels. Then invest all your skill points into archery bonuses and bam our lovely hero eivor has his bow turned from a bit of wood and string to a 50.cal anti tank rifle. So just because you have a power level of 40 it doesnt mean you cant defeat the strongest enemy in the game. Pro tip the best weapon in assasins creed valhalla is just any bow! So enjoy this ac valhalla montage!<br /><br />What you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. <br /><br />Magestic Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://freshmerch.fm/collections/spiffing-brit">https://freshmerch.fm/collections/spiffing-brit</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing">https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing</a><br />Twitter: @thespiffingbrit<br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/spiffing">https://discord.gg/spiffing</a><br /><br />Title: Assassins Creed Valhalla IS A PERFECTLY BALANCED GAME WITH NO EXPLOITS - Infinite Money Is Broken!<br /><br />#Exploit #AC #Valhalla
