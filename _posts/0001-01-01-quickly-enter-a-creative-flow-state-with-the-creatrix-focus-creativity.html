Quickly Enter a Creative Flow State with 'The Creatrix' - Focus &amp; Creativity with Isochronic Tones <br /><br />The latest in our series of focus &amp; creativity audios uses a minimal ambient backdrop to help get you into a creative flow state, a kind of relaxed awareness where ideas can flow forth effortlessly, in the moment. Our last track floated about at a steady pace of 12hz but here we reintroduce the dynamic interchange between theta, alpha and beta. If you want to know exactly what's going in frequency wise, geek out on this: <br /><br />Beta (12Hz) → Alpha (8-8.5hz) → Beta (13Hz) → Theta (7-7.5hz) → Beta (14hz) → Alpha (10hz) → Beta (14.5hz) → Theta (7-7.5hz) → Beta (15hz) → Alpha (10hz) → Beta (15.5hz) → Theta (7-7.5hz)<br /><br />Brainwave entrainment is administered in the form of isochronic tones, which are the rapid pulses you hear layered underneath the music. While not an 'exact science', rhythmic pulses, usually in the form of drum beats, have been used for thousands of years to assist with consciousness alteration. Entrainment simply provides a more modern day, techno-age equivalent. While simple in nature, it can provide an effective solution to quickly entering the state necessary for creative flow, which can be likened to an 'active meditation in motion'.  <br /><br />You should listen at a nice low-medium volume during study, creative writing, creative thinking, painting, drawing etc. Don't worry if the beats are not loud and clear - they are intended to have a more subliminal effect, which is further enhanced by the use of audiowave modulation, where the frequencies are embedded within the music itself. Headphones are optional. The process of brainwave syncronisation typically takes 10 minutes or so, but this will reduce over time as you get used to it and the beats start fading into the background. <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to The Brainwave Hub and be notified of all our audios- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2JxQWlH">https://bit.ly/2JxQWlH</a> <br /><br />Quickly Enter a Creative Flow State with 'The Creatrix' - Focus &amp; Creativity with Isochronic Tones <br /><br />◢ PLAYLISTS THAT MAY BENEFIT YOU<br /><br />These are divided into two forms of brainwave entrainment.
