Trainer Edita Daniute collaborated with WDSF in creating this learning resource on maintaining the basic principles of a dance. The video was recorded in August 2012 during the GOC in Stuttgart, GER. The WDSF wishes to acknowledge the support of Edita and the GOC organisers to the YouTraining DanceSport programme.
