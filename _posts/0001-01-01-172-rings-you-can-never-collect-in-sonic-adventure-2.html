There's 172 rings you can never collect in Sonic Adventure 2... Which is quite a lot for one single level. So why are these rings inaccessible? Let's talk about that.<br />ðŸ’¥ Subscribe or no rings for you â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/SwankyBox?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/user/SwankyBox?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Check out SPEEPSHighway's video! â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnfFm1u15gE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnfFm1u15gE</a><br />And Irregular Zero's too! â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhRmDcZV2Go">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhRmDcZV2Go</a><br /><br /><br />White Jungle in Sonic Adventure 2 has an absurdly high ring count that players can never actually reach. At best, we can only get around half of them. So what gives? Well apparently there's a whole world hidden above the stage that was left behind... Well, more so scraps of a world were left behind. This is mystery of White Jungle's lost rings, so I hope you enjoy!<br /><br /><br />Follow me on Twitter! â–º @SwankyBoxYT<br /><br />Check out SwankyZone! â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2p2bwMq">http://bit.ly/2p2bwMq</a><br /><br /><br /><br />#sonic #sonicadventure2 #sa2b #sonicthehedgehog<br /><br /><br />Credits and sources:<br /><br /><br /><br />Thumbnail Sonic render by Nibroc Rock.<br />Written by SwankyBox.<br /><br />Filming and editing by Stowgee and SwankyBox.<br /><br />Original documentation by SPEEPSHighway and Irregular Zero.<br /><br /><br />Music credits:<br /><br />Songs from various Sonic OST's<br /><br />&quot;Chao Garden&quot; - Sonic Adventure 2: Battle<br />&quot;Mystic Cave Classic Remix&quot; - Sonic Generations
