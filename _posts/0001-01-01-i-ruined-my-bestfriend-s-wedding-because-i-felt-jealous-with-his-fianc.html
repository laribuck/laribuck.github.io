Heck, I thought I'd be the one marrying him…well, I mean if no one better came along! <br /><br />Drew's 2 years older than me but back then I wasn't your regular girly girl, instead, I much preferred hanging out with the boys and playing basketball. So we quickly became best friends.<br />But when I hit puberty, how I looked began to matter more to me – so, I started making efforts and behaved more like a lady. Result being that guys started noticing me.<br /> Drew included, One time back in high school Drew asked me out but I just laughed it off and told him to stop kidding, in other words, I rejected him! It was good to know that I had him as a backup but right then and there I didn't want to date him, why would I, when I could have any boy in this school. After that he pretty much did anything I asked, treated me like a princess and followed me everywhere I went...<br /><br />Heck, we were sooo close that it was an in-joke with my family that we would end up together!  <br /> When I went to study in Europe for 3 years Drew was still there for me when I went through tough times, or even break-ups.<br /><br />Being in a different country meant that Drew and I didn't talk as much as we used too but I knew that if I needed him then all I needed to do was click my fingers and he'd appear. <br /><br />Whenever I came back home for the holidays, he was always there at the airport waiting to pick me up.
