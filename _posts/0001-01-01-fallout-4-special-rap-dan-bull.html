suddenly strike as you're over-encumbered<br />and should your special self have such a regrettable incident<br />you'd better get swinging any suitable weapon or implement<br /><br />PERCEPTION!<br />Post-nuclear places<br />are pretty prearranged<br />to put you through your paces<br />Pinpoint the parts of predators that plan to prey<br />with the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System<br />Hooray!<br />You may need to pickpocket<br />pinching for your own protection<br />practicing your pilfering<br />purloining to perfection<br />If your preferential predilection's<br />petty theft of peoples' possessions<br />you'll be protected by perception<br /><br />You're S.P.E.C.I.A.L.!<br />You're S.P.E.C.I.A.L.!<br />You're S.P.E.C.I.A.L.!<br />Oh so S.P.E.C.I.A.L.!<br

refresh your energy<br />by eating everything<br />even extra limbs and enemies<br />Your belly's not ever empty<br />there's endless entrées<br />Extend the length of time you exercise<br />eons, days<br />Escape encounters with louts and rowdy hooligans<br />or environments ensure you'll eventually be food again<br /><br />CHARISMA!<br />Communists conquered this clean continent<br />and concomitantly corruption was the consequence<br />As such, you must be confident<br />and cognizant of compliments<br />confirming that commercially you're consummately competent<br />Convert companions to confidantes<br />convincing them to change a cuddly toy<br />for cutlery and condiments<br />Swallow down countless cups of cocktails<br />and charm your way from harm, chum<br />Combat

/>INTELLIGENCE!<br />is idiocy inverted<br />Innate instinct<br />Take information and interpret it<br />The inner intuition and initiative<br />to impliment inventive ideas<br />to be inquisitive<br />It is indicative of ingrained imagination<br />to take an inspiration and create an innovation<br />Insure against injury through investigation<br />because ignorance induces incapacitation<br /><br />AGILITY!<br />After all the aggro<br />antagonists are all too available<br />there's no ASBOs<br />Accelerate your acts of accurate aim<br />and  have any angry adversaries aptly aflame<br />Avoid adverse assaults from automatics<br />Avert or annul their action with acrobatics<br />Agility!<br />Amazing adaptability<br />awesome!<br />What an absolutely ace ability<br /><br />You're S.P.E.C.I.A.L.!<br />You're S.P.E.C.I.A.L.!<br />You're S.P.E.C.I.A.L.!<br />Oh so S.P.E.C.I.A.L.!<br />S.P.E.C.I.A.L.<br />spells out that you're quite swell!<br /><br />LUCK!<br />The lady<br />that lowers the likelihood of life's lotto's loss for the lazy<br />When you're larking with lice<br />that are larger than life<br />at least you'll have the lethal last laugh and the like<br />The lie of the land's less than lavish and lovely<br />but when looking for loot you'll locate lots of luxury<br />Loads of little lowlifes leering at your luggage?<br />A lone laddy's liable to let them them learn what luck is<br /><br />Congratulations, you've passed the test<br />yes!<br />From everyone at Vault-Tec<br />splendid work on your success<br />Give yourself a pat on the back<br />and maybe shake hands<br />then perambulate into the haze of the wasteland<br />War<br />War never changes<br />Look at the history book's torn up pages<br />'cause when the dust settles after all out war<br />you'll be glad we taught you what to deal with fallout for<br /><br />You're S.P.E.C.I.A.L.!<br />You're S.P.E.C.I.A.L.!<br />You're S.P.E.C.I.A.L.!<br />Oh so S.P.E.C.I.A.L.!<br />S.P.E.C.I.A.L.<br
