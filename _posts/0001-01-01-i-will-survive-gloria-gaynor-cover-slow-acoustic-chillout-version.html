Here is my slow chill out acoustic cover of 'I Will Survive' I'm sure you will agree this is very different from the original. When I looked at the lyrics I realised that they were quite sad and dark and I wanted to bring this element out in my cover. I like to try and cover songs that are not always predictable and put my own stamp on it so hopefully you will like my spin on this disco classic. Let me know what you think in the comments? Does this work as a slow song?<br /><br />I've made a few covers recently of older songs which has been fun. Trying to cover modern songs all the time is really hard as I have to like the original song to want to make a cover and the charts have not really excited me much recently or I feel they don't suit my voice. There is a lot of rap in the charts and believe me I cannot rap haha.<br /><br />I know most people who watch my videos have already subscribed to my YouTube channel but incase you haven't use this link ➡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/XnpHVd">https://goo.gl/XnpHVd</a><br />Each week I try my best to upload a new cover so the best way to find out about new music releases by me is to hit that subscribe button and turn on notifications from my channel.<br /><br />Missed one of my videos or fancy a catch up?<br />All my songs in one YouTube playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/mjplaylist">http://bit.ly/mjplaylist</a><br /><br />All my music is on Spotify, Apple, Google Play, Amazon and every other well known music download and streaming platform worldwide.

Here are the lyrics.<br /><br />At first I was afraid, I was petrified,<br />Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side<br />But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong,<br />And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along.<br /><br />And so you're back from outer space.<br />I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face<br />I should have changed that stupid lock<br />I should have made you leave your key<br />If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me<br /><br />(Chorus)<br />Go on now, go. Walk out the door<br />Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore<br />Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?<br />Did you think I'd crumble?<br />Did you think I'd lay down and die?<br /><br />Oh, no, not I!<br />I will survive.<br />Oh, as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive.<br />I've got all my life to live.<br />I've got all my love to give.<br />And I'll survive,<br />I will survive, hey, hey.<br /><br />It took all the strength I had not to fall apart.<br />Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart.<br />And I spent, oh, so many nights just feeling sorry for myself.<br />I used to cry but now I hold my head up high.<br /><br />And you see me somebody new.<br />I'm not that chained-up little person still in love with you.<br />And so you felt like dropping in,<br />And just expect me to be free.<br />And now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me.<br /><br />Chorus repeat.
