This TEDx talk by Srividya Nagaraju is about the evolving role and power of Indian Women in history and current times; and their possible future. There are many stories of unsung Indian women whose extraordinary achievements represent today's India. As a speaker, trainer and social activist, Srividya gently yet persuasively influences women groups across the globe to realize their own power -SHAKTI.  She invoked the SHAKTI in her life to create a new future, an example for others to learn from. She shares a simple message for women across the globe to realize their own SHAKTI and spread the much needed gentle feminine power - the true need of the world.<br /><br />Srividya Nagaraju (Alumni of IIM-Bangalore) is an internationally acclaimed Speaker, renowned Learning Facilitator, pioneering effective learning for skill and behavior improvement. She has 20 years of rich experience in the corporate and social sector.  She is inspired by Dr.APJ Abdul Kalam, former President of India.<br /><br /><br /><br />Her USP is in her ability to work with individuals across age groups, hierarchical levels and sectors for bringing transformational changes in their lives through insightful experiences.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Having worked in the field of women and child development, she has a balanced understanding of the evolution and role of women across the world, especially Indian women.<br /><br /><br /><br />Based on several years of experience in empowering women and gender-sensitization programs for men, she believes in a pragmatic understanding of the needs of today's society than an adversarial approach just to evoke attention.<br /><br /><br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
