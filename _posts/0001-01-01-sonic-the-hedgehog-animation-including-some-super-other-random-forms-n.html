(Warning - some forms in this video aren't precise including transformations and have missed a couple of forms as well, this is just a little something I made to just show some of the forms off for fun, BUT I'm making a part 2 to fix them  just wait a little longer guys!) <br /><br />First of all I just want to say that I know most parts of the animation are not perfect such as the seven rings, I just really liked to show off all the rings and hyper sonic on the animation didn't look good when changing colour cause I couldn't fade it throughout each frame.<br /><br />This is a Sonic The Hedgehog Animation I started a year ago and have finally finished it.Also to quickly get this out of the way I did the sonic boom sonic before I saw the characters properly so sorry if you wanted a better version of him.Also these were all the sonic forms I could think off/know.By the way I couldn't draw Excalibur sonic but might do a mini animation video for classic sonic later in the future.<br /><br />I also got all the sound effects from this website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.sounds-resource.com/">http://www.sounds-resource.com/</a> <br /><br />By the way sorry if I have made some animation mistakes such as forgetting colour in certain areas like Darkspine Sonic's hands.... I found out that they were wrong a lot later after the uploading of the video.....<br /><br />And I'm not sure how sonic transforms into Hyper sonic, same as Dark sonic so I just added the master emerald/ chaos emeralds in.... I think it has something to do with super emeralds for Hyper??! Also I know that he's multi-coloured it just didn't look good on the animation, and I couldn't fade the colours throughout each frame in which would've helped so much<br />Thank you for understanding <br /><br />Hopefully you guys like watching this video if so like, and if you really like it, subscribe! :D<br />thanks!
