Watch as shoppers stop to watch my favourite piano dance mix.<br />Whilst shopping in Liverpool One Shopping centre I noticed a public piano that was empty so decided to play a mix of Dance Classics from the 1990s. Within minutes a crowd gathered and I was delighted with the applauds I received at the end of my performance.<br /><br />Time to start work on Dance Mix Number 2!<br />________________________________________________<br />If you enjoy my music please continue to watch my videos.<br />Leave me a tip?  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/Harrisonpiano90s?locale.x=en_GB">https://paypal.me/Harrisonpiano90s?locale.x=en_GB</a>
