We have the opportunity to seize every moment as either a validation of life, or we can use every moment as a way of negating the momentum of our magnificence. <br /><br />Being human is the greatest thing of all. No matter what it is we're going through, we recognize that we are going to get through it. <br /><br />Join us for daily meditation on Call to Calm: www.panachedesai.com/programs-and-coaching
