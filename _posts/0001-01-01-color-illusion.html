Look at the dot between the 2 colored squares. Blink regulary.<br /><br />When the white screen appears, blink sometimes, and you'll see that the squares has changed colors.<br /><br /><br /><br />It may not work for the color blinds.<br /><br /><br /><br />The music is from Vista's &quot;Example Music&quot;, called Karsh Kale - One Step Beyond.
