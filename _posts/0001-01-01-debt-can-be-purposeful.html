# ad <br />Back in the day, we used to travel the world, take late night flights and go out to eat at the hottest new restaurants. Now that we have a two year old...we can barely stay awake during commercials LOL! <br /><br />Raising a kid can be all-consuming. It’s easy to get stuck in the “rut” of routine, especially when they’re small. So we use date nights as a chance for us to reconnect and reflect on how we’ve changed over the years.<br /><br />Recently, we partnered with LightStream to capture a conversation about  our evolving perspective on debt. There was a time when we thought all debt was bad.  Now, we believe that when managed well, it can be a tool to simplify your life or bring you closer to achieving a purposeful goal. <br /><br />Companies like LightStream get it and make lending uncomplicated. If you’ve worked hard to have a good credit score, one of the ways you’re rewarded is through better terms and affordable rates. <br /><br />To learn more visit www.lightstream.com/richandregular
