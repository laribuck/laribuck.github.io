The men's FIFA World Ranking is a ranking system for men's national teams in association football, currently led by Belgium. The teams of the men's member nations of FIFA, football's world governing body, are ranked based on their game results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. The rankings were introduced in December 1992, and eight teams (Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain) have held the top position, of which Brazil have spent the longest ranked first.<br /><br /><br />A points system is used, with points being awarded based on the results of all FIFA-recognised full international matches.<br /><br /><br />The ranking system has been revamped on several occasions, generally responding to criticism that the preceding calculation method did not effectively reflect the relative strengths of the national teams. The current version of the ranking system was first used on 16 August 2018, adapted from the Elo rating system used in chess and Go.<br /><br /><br />Please Subscribe For More Upcoming Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/o2jNyz">https://goo.gl/o2jNyz</a><br /><br /><br />Animated Statistics, Statistics, Stats, Racing Bar Chart, Charts, Ranking<br /><br />FIFA RANKING<br />Ranking of men's national football teams<br />Ranking of football<br />National soccer teams
