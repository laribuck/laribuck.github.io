IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO HEAR A GRANDMOTHER SCREAM AND CRY WHILE GETTING HER TOENAILS, CORNS AND CALLUSES CUT BUT HEARTWARMING WHEN SHE THANKS DR. LEO KRAWETZ AFTER SHE IS ABLE TO WALK PAIN-FREE.  Elderly patients suffer with severely thick painful fungal toenails which are nearly impossible to cut so they get neglected.  The nails grow so long and so hard and the calluses and corns become severely thick and hard that it is difficult for the elderly to take care of cutting the nails and trimming the corns and calluses.  Dementia is a difficult disease because the elderly people who are afflicted with dementia will scream and yell and have exaggerated reactions to touch and pain when they are not in pain.  Always check the feet of your loved ones, especially the elderly to be sure they cut their toenails on a regular basis and are not a victim of foot and toenail neglect.<br />North Tampa<br />13801 Bruce B Downs Blvd #205, Tampa, FL 33613<br />Phone: (813) 971-4678<br /><br />South Tampa<br />2919 W Swann Ave #203, Tampa, FL 33609<br />Phone: (813) 875-0555<br /><br />Wesley Chapel<br />27658 Cashford Cir #102, Wesley Chapel, FL 33544<br />Phone: (813) 388-9801<br /><br />Brooksville<br />8925, 17222 Hospital Blvd #218, Brooksville, FL 34601<br /><br />#neglectedtoenails<br />#myfeetarekillingme<br />#fungus
