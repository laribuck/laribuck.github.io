The MSR Cable Picket sets a new standard for the snow anchors of mountain guides and recreationalist mountaineers during glacier travel. <br /><br />Learn more at msrgear.com/snow-tools/snow-anchors/cable-picket<br /><br />Built with feedback from the American Mountain Guides Association (AMGA), the picket features a permanently affixed cable to increase the speed and safety of your anchor setup. Boasting the superior strength of a T-beam design, the picket features an optimized length for maximum holding power with minimal weight, ideal for carrying during guiding and recreationalist climbs.
