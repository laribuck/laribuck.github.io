Deep Roots at Fox Hollow Flora in Eugene, Oregon growing award-winning craft cannabis. Hosted by Cameron Bravmann, Professor at Growers Network University and Principal at Green Belt Strategies. This is Season 1, Episode 2 of Canna Cribs Deep Roots.<br /><br />Fox Hollow Flora is a premium cannabis producer south of Eugene, Oregon. Fox Hollow Flora has been providing high quality flowers to medical dispensaries in the Eugene area since 2013. Their motivation is forged by the hard truth that you will always get out exactly what you put in. Their goal is to maintain responsible growth and continue exploring ways to understand their plants, their genetics, and their bar for excellence. Fox Hollow believes the country is depending on them to set a standard for Pacific Northwest cannabis that will be unmatched by any other region in the world.  They accept this honor to represent the great state of Oregon in this special moment of our nation’s history; they will never take it for granted.<br /> <br />Fox Hollow Flora strongly encourages cannabis users to buy Oregon grown and crafted. Oregon growers are humble to the plant, organically focused, and respectful of the earth.  Their rapidly growing cannabis industry is a symbol of respect, equality, and compassion.  It’s not about hype in Oregon weed; it’s quality over quantity in every aspect of the industry.<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Sign up for the Canna Cribs VIP Club!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mailchi.mp/growersnetwork/dr-s1-e2">https://mailchi.mp/growersnetwork/dr-s1-e2</a><br /><br />Powered by GroWash (Gruene Anolyte)<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Want to check out the equipment and products used in this episode?
