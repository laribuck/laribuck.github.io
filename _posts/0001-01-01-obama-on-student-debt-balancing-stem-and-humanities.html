An English professor asked President Barack Obama at a June 1 town hall in Elkhart, Indiana, about &quot;crushing student debt&quot; and why his policies have emphasized STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education. <br /><br />&quot;It used to be that most state universities were heavily subsidized by the state, so they kept tuition really, really low,&quot; President Obama said, explaining why the cost of public higher education rose sharply in the 1980s and 1990s.
