It’s business as usual for the fast-rising French producer, who is yet to put a foot wrong this year. Co-founder of Moonrise Hill Material and founder of FHUO Records (For Heaven Use Only), Folamour’s take on house music is exquisite, poetic and meticulously executed.<br /><br />On ‘Umami’ Folamour continues to explore his signature blissed-out sounds, mixing sample-heavy house with intricate percussion and life-affirming pads, all dripping with decadent jazz and disco influences; pure hazy lushness. Each track tells a unique story, engaging narrative threads that pulse and dwindle on hypnotic frequencies. High points include the energetic workout that is ‘Devoted To U’, Hip-Hop infused ‘Kickflippin’ That Stuff’ and the endearing warmth of ‘Look At Me Or I’ll Steal Your Eyes’. ‘Umami’ is a stunning work of art from a very thoughtful producer; prepare to be very impressed.
