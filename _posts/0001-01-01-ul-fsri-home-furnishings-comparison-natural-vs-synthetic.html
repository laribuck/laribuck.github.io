In 2020, the UL FSRI team captured a new side-by-side burn comparison of natural vs. synthetic furnished rooms. Since the original comparison video was shared in 2009, UL FSRI has repeated the same experiment several times with similar results in terms of flashover times between the natural and synthetic furnished rooms. The flashover data from those experiments has been incorporated into this new video that has been captured in much crisper detail than its predecessor thanks to vast video technology enhancements.<br /><br />For more on the research behind this video, visit the project page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ulfirefightersafety.org/research-projects/comparison-of-synthetic-and-natural-home-furnishings.html">https://ulfirefightersafety.org/research-projects/comparison-of-synthetic-and-natural-home-furnishings.html</a>
