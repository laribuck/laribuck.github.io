It was cold and windy.  We were hungry and tired.  Walking along a quiet road on the island of Nolsoy, we happened to meet Grandma Disa.  With her friendly smile and kind eyes, she invited us into her home for a warm cup of coffee and freshly baked bread.  <br /><br />She told us that she often invites foreigners into her house because she loves meeting new people from around the world.  It helps to remind her that we're not that different.  And from her, we learnt that kindness goes a long way.  True wealth is not in our wallets - it's in our hearts.<br /><br />To be part of our film making journey - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/greenrenaissance">https://www.patreon.com/greenrenaissance</a> <br /><br />Filmed in Nolsoy, Faroe Islands.<br /><br />Who is Green Renaissance?
