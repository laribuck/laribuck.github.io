Within the film, an advanced editing technique ‘rotoscoping’ was used by Cut Media to enable the audience to see what's going through Matt’s head as he prepared for seemingly impossible tricks. This required an intricate process, cutting out countless sequential frames, in order to create the floating ‘traces’ seen in the final production.<br /><br />#redbull #MattJones #MTB<br /><br />Song by Temples: ‘A Question Isn’t Answered’<br />Written by James Bagshaw, Thomas Walmsley, Adam Smith, Samuel Toms<br />Published by Imagem Music<br />Courtesy of  Heavenly Recordings/[PIAS] 2014<br /><br />-<br /><br />Experience the world of Red Bull like you have never seen it before.
