Name: Stratoblizz <br /><br />Elements: Void, Nimbus, Spark <br /><br />Bio: Stratoblizz was produced when the Dark Void was conjured. The two heads found their way into the spot where Cosmogloop stood and attempted to help him as well. They got hypnotised by their friends in the Void because they were betraying them. This meant Cosmogloop had another monster to defend.<br /><br />Thanks to Typically#6963 for helping with the sound, design and name for this monster!<br /><br />7/15<br /><br />Discord Server: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/c25nVtJ">https://discord.gg/c25nVtJ</a><br /><br />Portions of the materials used are trademarks and/or copyrighted works of Big Blue Bubble.
