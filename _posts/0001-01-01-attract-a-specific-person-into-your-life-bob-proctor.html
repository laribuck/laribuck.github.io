Bob Proctor teaches you How To Attract a Specific Person Into Your Life. <br /><br />If you follow the process I describe in this video to a T, you can attract a person that you‚Äôre in perfect harmony with.<br /><br />That‚Äôs your intention, right?<br /><br />I ask because this is a scientific practice; so your intention must be very clear. Wherever you intend to land is precisely where you will land.<br /><br />Aim high and feel good!<br /><br />So, set your standards high. Be faithful to what you really want, not what you will settle for. Without putting a face on the person, start to see yourself with someone who has all the qualities you want.<br /><br />Think about it this way‚Ä¶<br /><br />If you were creating a plan for a flight from Toronto to Miami, you wouldn‚Äôt say that you‚Äôll land somewhere in Miami on Monday afternoon. You‚Äôd say that you intend to land at Miami International Airport at 2:43 p.m.<br /><br />That‚Äôs the kind of specificity you need when you‚Äôre setting out to attract your dream partner.<br /><br />As you go through each day, remember you can only attract to you what you‚Äôre in harmonious vibration with. So what you think about and how you feel most of the time is what you will attract.<br /><br />Is this for real?<br /><br />I know some of what I suggest in this video may seem preposterous to you.<br /><br />I assure you, it‚Äôs not. It has worked for many, many people.<br /><br />So don‚Äôt brush this off if you‚Äôre serious about attracting someone special into your life. Do everything I suggest.<br /><br />I promise you‚Äôll like the results.<br /><br />To your success,<br /><br />Bob Proctor<br /><br />For more than half a century, Bob Proctor has been the foremost authority in the personal and professional development field. Bob Proctor has dedicated his adult life to helping a world of individuals realize and act on the greatness they already possess within themselves. He‚Äôs widely regarded as the grandfather of personal development, and when it comes to mastering the mind ‚Äì he is simply the best.<br /><br />After meeting Bob Proctor, Sandy Gallagher, an esteemed banking attorney, created Thinking into Results ‚Äì the most powerful corporate transformational program of its kind. Sandy is now the Co-Founder, President, and CEO of Proctor Gallagher Institute. A genius businesswoman and visioneering expert committed to improving the conscious awareness of the entire world, one individual at a time.<br /><br />Now, I have an enormous library of books. I have attended I don't know how many programs, courses. I've studied since 1961. Never stopped studying. I study every day. I really believe that this is without question the most valuable idea I have ever learned. You see if we're going to understand the law of attraction we've got to get right down to the basics. We've got to reduce everything to the ridiculous. We've got to understand where does it starts. It's because most people don't understand this that they never really change.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed that people that are losing, they generally keep losing, and people that are winning, they generally keep winning? It's just that there's so many losing versus the winners. I think you're going to get a real insight into that as we dig into this. I really do. Let's think of who we are first of all. You know, I learned a long time ago that our spiritual DNA is perfect. There's perfection within us. It doesn't require any modification and it doesn't require any improvement. Now think of that for a moment. Yours, mine, our spiritual DNA. I'm not talking about the thing we're measuring. What we're measuring here is what's piled on top of the essence of who you are.<br /><br />1Ô∏è‚É£ Leave a comment below with your biggest takeaway from this videoüëá<br />2Ô∏è‚É£ Share this video with someone else who needs to hear this message today ü§ü<br />3Ô∏è‚É£ Be the first to know when we release new videos üëç <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/VL0Smo">http://goo.gl/VL0Smo</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è Create YOUR Winner's Image to attract your dream partner üëâ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2IJBcqZ">https://bit.ly/2IJBcqZ</a> üëà<br /><br />Check out our most popular video series!<br />1.
