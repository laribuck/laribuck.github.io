I fully remade a tool that was patented in 1878.  This specific patent in on a very odd design which includes a hand plane within the handle of a chisel.  You can see that patent document here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US202105">https://patents.google.com/patent/US202105</a><br /><br />I decided to use brass and Brazilian cherry as the materials for the tool.  I did not have any specific measurements to reference so all decisions on design were made through the patent drawing.  While the final outward appearance of the tool is close to the patent design, I did choose to attach the brass portions by threading them into the wood plane body, for extra strength.<br /><br />I have not made a hand plane solely by carving it out with chisels, so this was a large challenge for me.  I did practice several times and found that purchasing some specific plane-making tools (plane floats) were key to success.<br /><br />I found this patent recreation process to be incredibly rewarding and it was great seeing each piece come together.  I hope to do many more in the future.<br /><br />Wrenches are now for sale at www.handtoolrescue.com<br /><br />Help secure more tools for future videos (if you want): <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/handtoolrescue">https://www.patreon.com/handtoolrescue</a><br /><br />Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/handtoolrescue">https://www.instagram.com/handtoolrescue</a><br /><br />Facebook Group - Share your restorations<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/handtoolrescue">https://www.facebook.com/groups/handtoolrescue</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/handtoolrescue/">https://www.facebook.com/handtoolrescue/</a><br /><br />Reddit - Share your restorations<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HandToolRescue/">https://www.reddit.com/r/HandToolRescue/</a><br /><br />Podcast (with Jimmy DiResta and Andrew Alexander) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://anchor.fm/fitzall">https://anchor.fm/fitzall</a>
