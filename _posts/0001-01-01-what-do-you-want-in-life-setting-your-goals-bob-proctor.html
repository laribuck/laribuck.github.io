worked<br />all over the world.<br />I mean<br />all over Asia, China, South America, North America, Europe.<br />And I'm always asking people,<br />what do you really want?<br />And I have found,<br />most people don't want to be really wealthy.<br />What they do want,<br />is they don't want to have any financial concerns.<br />If they want to buy a new suit,<br />they can go and get one.<br />If they want to take a trip,<br />they can take the trip.<br />If they want a new car,<br />they get the new car.<br />They don’t want to just run and spend or buy,<br />they don't want to have any financial concerns<br />Two,<br />they want to wake up in the morning<br />excited about how they're going to spend their day.<br />And the third,<br />they want to mix with people<br />who are upbeat,<br />and creatively productive.<br />Those are the three things that people really want.<br />So an answer to your question if somebody is watching,<br />what's the first thing they should do.<br />Well the first thing they should do is understand<br />why we have goals,<br />not just to set a goal,<br />because most people don't set goals right.<br />They are operating with a limited level of consciousness.<br />So they're thinking:<br />“if I could get a little more money,<br />and if I could get him to help me,<br />and her to help me,<br />and this happened,<br />then I could do this”.<br />Maybe this is getting a new car.<br />What we've got to understand is,<br />we're trading our life for our goals,<br />literally trading our life.<br />Would you trade your life for a car?<br />Or a house?<br />I don't think so.<br />So it's got to be something really meaningful.<br />And we're not taught to think this way.<br />We should sit down,<br />and don't give any thought to<br />where the money is going to come from,<br />where they helped going to come from,<br />it's what you really want.<br />Ed Hillary was a beekeeper in Auckland.<br />He wanted to climb Mount Everest,<br />it had never been done,<br />people died trying to do it.<br />He went in 1951 and failed,<br />he went back in 1952 and failed.<br />In 1953 he stood on the top of the mountain with Tenzing Norgay.<br />But he didn't know how to get there<br />until after he had got there.<br />Edison didn't know how to illuminate the world<br />until after he had done it.<br />The Wright Brothers were bicycle mechanics in Dayton Ohio.<br />No one believed they could fly,<br />they'd been trying it for years,<br />but they wanted to do it.<br />They didn't know how,<br />and they couldn't tell you until after they had done it.<br />Now their first flight only lasted 12 seconds,<br />and the naysayers said:<br />“yes, but they only were up there for 12 seconds”.<br />They said : ”We not only got up there,<br />we kept the damn thing up there for 12 seconds”.<br />So when a person sets a goal,<br />they've got to say:<br />“what could I want,<br />if I just let my mind just wander,<br />use my imagination,<br />how do I really want to live?”<br />That's what they should be doing,<br />that's where it should start.<br />And then don't listen to anyone that tells them they can't.<br />Go to someone,<br />who has done something,<br />and ask them:<br />“what should I do?”<br />And then do exactly what the person tells them.<br /><br />Additional Tags:<br />what do you
