Nature brings about a destruction in order to bring forth anew’, wrote Schiller. Covid-19 has certainly presented a challenge to the library in bringing forth anew, especially for the live music series. But the word of the day is JOY!!! I am delighted to announce the Basalt Regional Library is launching our Virtual Fall Music Series in an attempt to once again provide excellent music from your library.<br /><br />“Broadway to Jazz” will bring early joy to your Thanksgiving holidays on Thursday, November 19. Local performers Cathy Markle, Mike Monroney, David Dyer and Steve Cole will captivate you with their rendition of songs from Broadway musicals that became jazz standards. No December can pass without the sounds of the Roaring Fork Youth Orchestra performing seasonal songs for us. To carry on the tradition, a selected chamber group and their mentors/teachers will perform the familiar songs from many traditions on Thursday, December 17.<br />​<br />I send my sincere thanks for your continued support of the library’s music series. As I reminded you in my cancellation statement, ‘without you there would be no series’. Together, let us continue to meet the challenge of maintaining excellence in the interaction of crisis and creativity. Please mark your calendars and view our series on Grass Roots TV on Thursdays of each month at the usual hour, 5:30 pm.<br /><br />GrassRoots TV is the country’s first and oldest community cable television station. <br /> <br />Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE, HIT LIKE and leave a COMMENT to let us know if you enjoyed this video, it is important to us and the community to become part of the conversation.
