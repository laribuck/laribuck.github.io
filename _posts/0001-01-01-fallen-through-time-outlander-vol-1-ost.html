The fourth track on the divine and heavenly &quot;Outlander&quot; Vol. 1 OST composed by Bear McCreary and featuring vocals by Raya Yarbrough. This track is one of my favorites and includes several lovely renditions of the Claire and Jamie theme. All credit goes to the original composer and no infringement is intended.
