His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy<br />There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti<br />He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready<br />To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting<br />What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud<br />He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out<br />He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now<br />The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!<br />Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope<br />There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't<br />Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows<br />His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope<br />He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows<br />When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's<br />Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody<br />Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />You better lose yourself in the music<br />The moment, you own it, you better never let it go<br />You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br />This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br />You better lose yourself in the music<br />The moment, you own it, you better never let it go<br />You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br />This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br />You better…<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping<br />This world is mine for the taking, make me king<br />As we move toward a New World Order<br />A normal life is boring; but superstardom's<br />Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder<br />Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over<br />These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows<br />He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads<br />God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father<br />He goes home and barely knows his own daughter<br />But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water<br />These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product<br />They moved on to the next schmoe who flows<br />He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera<br />Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner<br />But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />You better lose yourself in the music<br />The moment, you own it, you better never let it go<br />You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br />This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br />You better lose yourself in the music<br />The moment, you own it, you better never let it go<br />You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br />This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br />You better…<br /><br />[Verse 3]<br />No more games, I'ma change what you call rage<br />Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged<br />I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed<br />I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage<br />But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher<br />Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper<br />All the pain inside amplified by the<br />Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-<br />Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family<br />'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers<br />And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life<br />And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder<br />Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter<br />Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna<br />Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna<br />Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's<br />Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got<br />To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot<br />Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not<br />Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got<br />To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot<br />So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not<br />This may be the only opportunity that I got<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />You better lose yourself in the music<br />The moment, you own it, you better never let it go<br />You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br />This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br />You better lose yourself in the music<br />The moment, you own it, you better never let it go<br />You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br />This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br />You better…<br /><br />[Outro]<br />You can do anything you set your mind to, man
