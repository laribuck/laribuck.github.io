Wanda Sykes admitted to Ellen she's feeling anxious on Election Day, and joked that she hasn't slept since 2017. Plus, since the comedian has been living in Pennsylvania, she talked about what it's been like being in the swing state during election season, and shared how her wife and kids spent time in France this summer.
