The main one's I discuss in the video are power, electronics, RF, and controls. Students who enter into electrical engineering will all take mostly the same classes up until normally their 3rd or 4th year. By that time they take classes that are specific to these concentrations and subfields. The electrical engineering major can lead to many types of career paths in all these different fields so if you enjoy any of them, then it may be a good major for you. You will learn a little about all the concentrations but later on you should be able to pick which one you like the most. Most engineering majors have concentrations like this so be sure to look into specifically what you want to get out of a given college major and what career path will be best for you. <br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/zachstar/">https://www.instagram.com/zachstar/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ImZachStar">https://twitter.com/ImZachStar</a>
