Lisa had to leave very suddenly because of A family member that has covid and also the USA will not allow her to fly back to DR. This virus has made this project very difficult for sure and now we lost a crew member over this too...<br /><br />We will see Lisa again soon in the future when it is easy to travel again.<br /><br />Please support my work:<br /><br />Consider becoming a Patron -  it helps so much!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/thepaperboatproject">https://www.patreon.com/thepaperboatproject</a><br /><br />Rather send us a small  SURPRISE?<br />Paypal email: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/wethankyouman?locale.x=en_US">https://paypal.me/wethankyouman?locale.x=en_US</a><br /><br />You are Awesome!<br />Captain Leeu<br />Stefan Heiberg
