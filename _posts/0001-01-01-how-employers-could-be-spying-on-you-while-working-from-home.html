Some managers and CEOs are turning to &quot;productivity management&quot; software to track their employees while they work from home. How do systems like this affect employees? And are there limits to the ways in which employers can track their workers in pursuit of productivity?<br /><br />According to a new survey, 77% of workers want to continue to work from home at least once a week when the coronavirus pandemic is over.<br /><br />But many managers worry that employees won’t work as much, or as hard, when they’re not in view.
