Planet Earth&quot; is a 2006 television series produced by the BBC Natural History Unit. I did this montage to promote what I consider being the best documentary  about our planet. I am grateful for life for the hard work BBC put into this. Many years will pass and I doubt other series will reach this quality and cinematography. I do not own the original footage and I am not making any money out of it. After I have watched all eleven episodes, I tried to compress the best shots in just one montage. That's how I come up with this marvelous 13 minutes. If you really like this I suggest you to watch the hole documentary because at the end of each fifty-minute episode, a ten-minute featurette takes a behind-the-scenes look at the challenges of filming the series.<br />____________________________________________________________<br /><br />MY FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Robert-Revol/513509595334572">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Robert-Revol/513509595334572</a><br />MY TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/RobertRevol">https://twitter.com/RobertRevol</a><br />MY INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/robertrevol">http://www.instagram.com/robertrevol</a>
