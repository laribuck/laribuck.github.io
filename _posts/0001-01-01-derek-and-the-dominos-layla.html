Title: Layla<br />Artist: Derek And The Dominos<br />Album: Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs<br />Year: 1970<br /><br />I do not claim ownership to this song.<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />What'll you do when you get lonely<br />And nobody's waiting by your side?<br />You've been running and hiding much too long.<br />You know it's just your foolish pride.<br /><br />Layla, you've got me on my knees.<br />Layla, I'm begging, darling please.<br />Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.<br /><br />I tried to give you consolation<br />When your old man had let you down.<br />Like a fool, I fell in love with you,<br />Turned my whole world upside down.<br /><br />Chorus<br /><br />Let's make the best of the situation<br />Before I finally go insane.<br />Please don't say we'll never find a way<br />And tell me all my love's in vain.<br /><br />Chorus<br /><br />Chorus
