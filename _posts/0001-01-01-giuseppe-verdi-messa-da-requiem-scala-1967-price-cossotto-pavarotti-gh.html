Let's try to demonstrates the power and also limitations of the implementation of Artificial Intelligence in video editing and post production.<br />The video fragment is presented here in 1920 x 1440. The source footage is only commercially available so far in SD format (720x480).<br />The resulting new resolution is more than twice bigger.<br />The difference between the original and this new version makes it unique considering the fact that it was process with Artificial Intelligence algorithm. You can argue with the quality of the result, of course. I always say &quot;This is an illusion, it's an interpretation&quot;.<br />The better the source, the better the result.
